perlapi - autogenerated documentation for the perl public API

=head1 DESCRIPTION
X<Perl API> X<API> X<api>

This file contains most of the documentation of the perl public API, as
generated by F<embed.pl>.  Specifically, it is a listing of functions,
macros, flags, and variables that may be used by extension writers.  Besides
L<perlintern> and F<config.h>, some items are listed here as being actually
documented in another pod.

L<At the end|/Undocumented elements> is a list of functions which have yet
to be documented.  Patches welcome!  The interfaces of these are subject to
change without notice.

Some of the functions documented here are consolidated so that a single entry
serves for multiple functions which all do basically the same thing, but have
some slight differences.  For example, one form might process magic, while
another doesn't.  The name of each variation is listed at the top of the
single entry.  But if all have the same signature (arguments and return type)
except for their names, only the usage for the base form is shown.  If any
one of the forms has a different signature (such as returning C<const> or
not) every function's signature is explicitly displayed.

Anything not listed here or in the other mentioned pods is not part of the
public API, and should not be used by extension writers at all.  For these
reasons, blindly using functions listed in F<proto.h> is to be avoided when
writing extensions.

In Perl, unlike C, a string of characters may generally contain embedded
C<NUL> characters.  Sometimes in the documentation a Perl string is referred
to as a "buffer" to distinguish it from a C string, but sometimes they are
both just referred to as strings.

Note that all Perl API global variables must be referenced with the C<PL_>
prefix.  Again, those not listed here are not to be used by extension writers,
and can be changed or removed without notice; same with macros.
Some macros are provided for compatibility with the older,
unadorned names, but this support may be disabled in a future release.

Perl was originally written to handle US-ASCII only (that is characters
whose ordinal numbers are in the range 0 - 127).
And documentation and comments may still use the term ASCII, when
sometimes in fact the entire range from 0 - 255 is meant.

The non-ASCII characters below 256 can have various meanings, depending on
various things.  (See, most notably, L<perllocale>.)  But usually the whole
range can be referred to as ISO-8859-1.  Often, the term "Latin-1" (or
"Latin1") is used as an equivalent for ISO-8859-1.  But some people treat
"Latin1" as referring just to the characters in the range 128 through 255, or
sometimes from 160 through 255.
This documentation uses "Latin1" and "Latin-1" to refer to all 256 characters.

Note that Perl can be compiled and run under either ASCII or EBCDIC (See
L<perlebcdic>).  Most of the documentation (and even comments in the code)
ignore the EBCDIC possibility.
For almost all purposes the differences are transparent.
As an example, under EBCDIC,
instead of UTF-8, UTF-EBCDIC is used to encode Unicode strings, and so
whenever this documentation refers to C<utf8>
(and variants of that name, including in function names),
it also (essentially transparently) means C<UTF-EBCDIC>.
But the ordinals of characters differ between ASCII, EBCDIC, and
the UTF- encodings, and a string encoded in UTF-EBCDIC may occupy a different
number of bytes than in UTF-8.

The organization of this document is tentative and subject to change.

=head1 AV Handling

=over 4

=item C<AV>

Described in L<perlguts>.

=back

=for hackers
Found in file pod/perlguts.pod

=over 4

=item C<AvARRAY>
X<AvARRAY>

Returns a pointer to the AV's internal SV* array.

This is useful for doing pointer arithmetic on the array.
If all you need is to look up an array element, then prefer C<av_fetch>.

=over 3

 SV**  AvARRAY(AV* av)

=back

=back

=for hackers
Found in file av.h

=over 4

=item C<av_clear>
X<av_clear>

Frees all the elements of an array, leaving it empty.
The XS equivalent of C<@array = ()>.  See also L</av_undef>.

Note that it is possible that the actions of a destructor called directly
or indirectly by freeing an element of the array could cause the reference
count of the array itself to be reduced (e.g. by deleting an entry in the
symbol table). So it is a possibility that the AV could have been freed
(or even reallocated) on return from the call unless you hold a reference
to it.

=over 3

 void  av_clear(AV *av)

=back

=back

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=over 4

=item C<av_count>
X<av_count>

Returns the number of elements in the array C<av>.  This is the true length of
the array, including any undefined elements.  It is always the same as
S<C<av_top_index(av) + 1>>.

=over 3

 Size_t  av_count(AV *av)

=back

=back

=for hackers
Found in file inline.h

=over 4

=item C<av_create_and_push>
X<av_create_and_push>

NOTE: C<av_create_and_push> is B<experimental> and may change or be
removed without notice.

Push an SV onto the end of the array, creating the array if necessary.
A small internal helper function to remove a commonly duplicated idiom.

NOTE: C<av_create_and_push> must be explicitly called as
C<Perl_av_create_and_push>
with an C<aTHX_> parameter.

=over 3

 void  Perl_av_create_and_push(pTHX_ AV **const avp,
                               SV *const val)

=back

=back

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=over 4

=item C<av_create_and_unshift_one>
X<av_create_and_unshift_one>

NOTE: C<av_create_and_unshift_one> is B<experimental> and may change or be
removed without notice.

Unshifts an SV onto the beginning of the array, creating the array if
necessary.
A small internal helper function to remove a commonly duplicated idiom.

NOTE: C<av_create_and_unshift_one> must be explicitly called as
C<Perl_av_create_and_unshift_one>
with an C<aTHX_> parameter.

=over 3

 SV**  Perl_av_create_and_unshift_one(pTHX_ AV **const avp,
                                      SV *const val)

=back

=back

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=over 4

=item C<av_delete>
X<av_delete>

Deletes the element indexed by C<key> from the array, makes the element
mortal, and returns it.  If C<flags> equals C<G_DISCARD>, the element is
freed and NULL is returned. NULL is also returned if C<key> is out of
range.

Perl equivalent: S<C<splice(@myarray, $key, 1, undef)>> (with the
C<splice> in void context if C<G_DISCARD> is present).

=over 3

 SV*  av_delete(AV *av, SSize_t key, I32 flags)

=back

=back

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=over 4

=item C<av_exists>
X<av_exists>

Returns true if the element indexed by C<key> has been initialized.

This relies on the fact that uninitialized array elements are set to
C<NULL>.

Perl equivalent: C<exists($myarray[$key])>.

=over 3

 bool  av_exists(AV *av, SSize_t key)

=back

=back

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=over 4

=item C<av_extend>
X<av_extend>

Pre-extend an array so that it is capable of storing values at indexes
C<0..key>. Thus C<av_extend(av,99)> guarantees that the array can store 100
elements, i.e. that C<av_store(av, 0, sv)> through C<av_store(av, 99, sv)>
on a plain array will work without any further memory allocation.

If the av argument is a tied array then will call the C<EXTEND> tied
array method with an argument of C<(key+1)>.

=over 3

 void  av_extend(AV *av, SSize_t key)

=back

=back

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=over 4

=item C<av_fetch>
X<av_fetch>

Returns the SV at the specified index in the array.  The C<key> is the
index.  If lval is true, you are guaranteed to get a real SV back (in case
it wasn't real before), which you can then modify.  Check that the return
value is non-null before dereferencing it to a C<SV*>.

See L<perlguts/"Understanding the Magic of Tied Hashes and Arrays"> for
more information on how to use this function on tied arrays. 

The rough perl equivalent is C<$myarray[$key]>.

=over 3

 SV**  av_fetch(AV *av, SSize_t key, I32 lval)

=back

=back

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=over 4

=item C<AvFILL>
X<AvFILL>

Same as C<L</av_top_index>> or C<L</av_tindex>>.

=over 3

 SSize_t  AvFILL(AV* av)

=back

=back

=for hackers
Found in file av.h

=over 4

=item C<av_fill>
X<av_fill>

Set the highest index in the array to the given number, equivalent to
Perl's S<C<$#array = $fill;>>.

The number of elements in the array will be S<C<fill + 1>> after
C<av_fill()> returns.  If the array was previously shorter, then the
additional elements appended are set to NULL.  If the array
was longer, then the excess elements are freed.  S<C<av_fill(av, -1)>> is
the same as C<av_clear(av)>.

=over 3

 void  av_fill(AV *av, SSize_t fill)

=back

=back

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=over 4

=item C<av_len>
X<av_len>

Same as L</av_top_index>.  Note that, unlike what the name implies, it returns
the maximum index in the array.  This is unlike L</sv_len>, which returns what
you would expect.

B<To get the true number of elements in the array, instead use C<L</av_count>>>.

=over 3

 SSize_t  av_len(AV *av)

=back

=back

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=over 4

=item C<av_make>
X<av_make>

Creates a new AV and populates it with a list of SVs.  The SVs are copied
into the array, so they may be freed after the call to C<av_make>.  The new AV
will have a reference count of 1.

Perl equivalent: C<my @new_array = ($scalar1, $scalar2, $scalar3...);>

=over 3

 AV*  av_make(SSize_t size, SV **strp)

=back

=back

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=over 4

=item C<av_pop>
X<av_pop>

Removes one SV from the end of the array, reducing its size by one and
returning the SV (transferring control of one reference count) to the
caller.  Returns C<&PL_sv_undef> if the array is empty.

Perl equivalent: C<pop(@myarray);>

=over 3

 SV*  av_pop(AV *av)

=back

=back

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=over 4

=item C<av_push>
X<av_push>

Pushes an SV (transferring control of one reference count) onto the end of the
array.  The array will grow automatically to accommodate the addition.

Perl equivalent: C<push @myarray, $val;>.

=over 3

 void  av_push(AV *av, SV *val)

=back

=back

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=over 4

=item C<av_shift>
X<av_shift>

Removes one SV from the start of the array, reducing its size by one and
returning the SV (transferring control of one reference count) to the
caller.  Returns C<&PL_sv_undef> if the array is empty.

Perl equivalent: C<shift(@myarray);>

=over 3

 SV*  av_shift(AV *av)

=back

=back

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=over 4

=item C<av_store>
X<av_store>

Stores an SV in an array.  The array index is specified as C<key>.  The
return value will be C<NULL> if the operation failed or if the value did not
need to be actually stored within the array (as in the case of tied
arrays).  Otherwise, it can be dereferenced
to get the C<SV*> that was stored
there (= C<val>)).

Note that the caller is responsible for suitably incrementing the reference
count of C<val> before the call, and decrementing it if the function
returned C<NULL>.

Approximate Perl equivalent: C<splice(@myarray, $key, 1, $val)>.

See L<perlguts/"Understanding the Magic of Tied Hashes and Arrays"> for
more information on how to use this function on tied arrays.

=over 3

 SV**  av_store(AV *av, SSize_t key, SV *val)

=back

=back

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=over 4

=item C<av_tindex>

=item C<av_top_index>
X<av_tindex>X<av_top_index>

These behave identically.
If the array C<av> is empty, these return -1; otherwise they return the maximum
value of the indices of all the array elements which are currently defined in
C<av>.

They process 'get' magic.

The Perl equivalent for these is C<$#av>.

Use C<L</av_count>> to get the number of elements in an array.

 SSize_t  av_tindex(AV *av)

=back

=back

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=over 4

=item C<av_undef>
X<av_undef>

Undefines the array. The XS equivalent of C<undef(@array)>.

As well as freeing all the elements of the array (like C<av_clear()>), this
also frees the memory used by the av to store its list of scalars.

See L</av_clear> for a note about the array possibly being invalid on
return.

=over 3

 void  av_undef(AV *av)

=item C<av_unshift>
X<av_unshift>

Unshift the given number of C<undef> values onto the beginning of the
array.  The array will grow automatically to accommodate the addition.

Perl equivalent: S<C<unshift @myarray, ((undef) x $num);>>

=over 3

 void  av_unshift(AV *av, SSize_t num)

=back

=item C<get_av>
X<get_av>

Returns the AV of the specified Perl global or package array with the given
name (so it won't work on lexical variables).  C<flags> are passed 
to C<gv_fetchpv>.  If C<GV_ADD> is set and the
Perl variable does not exist then it will be created.  If C<flags> is zero
and the variable does not exist then NULL is returned.

Perl equivalent: C<@{"$name"}>.

X<call_argv>

Performs a callback to the specified named and package-scoped Perl subroutine 
with C<argv> (a C<NULL>-terminated array of strings) as arguments.  See
L<perlcall>.

Approximate Perl equivalent: C<&{"$sub_name"}(@$argv)>.

=item C<call_sv>
X<call_sv>

Performs a callback to the Perl sub specified by the SV.

If neither the C<G_METHOD> nor C<G_METHOD_NAMED> flag is supplied, the
SV may be any of a CV, a GV, a reference to a CV, a reference to a GV
or C<SvPV(sv)> will be used as the name of the sub to call.

If the C<G_METHOD> flag is supplied, the SV may be a reference to a CV or
C<SvPV(sv)> will be used as the name of the method to call.

If the C<G_METHOD_NAMED> flag is supplied, C<SvPV(sv)> will be used as
the name of the method to call.

Some other values are treated specially for internal use and should
not be depended on.

=head1 Character case changing


Perl uses "full" Unicode case mappings.  This means that converting a single
character to another case may result in a sequence of more than one character.
For example, the uppercase of C<E<223>> (LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S) is the two
character sequence C<SS>.  This presents some complications   The lowercase of
all characters in the range 0..255 is a single character, and thus
C<L</toLOWER_L1>> is furnished.  But, C<toUPPER_L1> can't exist, as it couldn't
return a valid result for all legal inputs.  Instead C<L</toUPPER_uvchr>> has
an API that does allow every possible legal result to be returned.)  Likewise
no other function that is crippled by not being able to give the correct
results for the full range of possible inputs has been implemented here.

=item C<toFOLD>
X<toFOLD>

Converts the specified character to foldcase.  If the input is anything but an
ASCII uppercase character, that input character itself is returned.  Variant
C<toFOLD_A> is equivalent.  (There is no equivalent C<to_FOLD_L1> for the full
Latin1 range, as the full generality of L</toFOLD_uvchr> is needed there.)

=item C<toFOLD_utf8>

=item C<toFOLD_utf8_safe>
X<toFOLD_utf8>X<toFOLD_utf8_safe>

Converts the first UTF-8 encoded character in the sequence starting at C<p> and
extending no further than S<C<e - 1>> to its foldcase version, and
stores that in UTF-8 in C<s>, and its length in bytes in C<lenp>.  Note
that the buffer pointed to by C<s> needs to be at least C<UTF8_MAXBYTES_CASE+1>
bytes since the foldcase version may be longer than the original character.

The first code point of the foldcased version is returned
(but note, as explained at L<the top of this section|/Character case
changing>, that there may be more).

It will not attempt
to read beyond S<C<e - 1>>, provided that the constraint S<C<s E<lt> e>> is
true (this is asserted for in C<-DDEBUGGING> builds).  If the UTF-8 for the
input character is malformed in some way, the program may croak, or the
function may return the REPLACEMENT CHARACTER, at the discretion of the
implementation, and subject to change in future releases.

C<toFOLD_utf8_safe> is now just a different spelling of plain C<toFOLD_utf8>

These all return the lowercase of a character.  The differences are what domain
they operate on, and whether the input is specified as a code point (those
forms with a C<cp> parameter) or as a UTF-8 string (the others).  In the latter
case, the code point to use is the first one in the buffer of UTF-8 encoded
code points, delineated by the arguments S<C<p .. e - 1>>.

C<toLOWER> and C<toLOWER_A> are synonyms of each other.  They return the
lowercase of any uppercase ASCII-range code point.  All other inputs are
returned unchanged.  Since these are macros, the input type may be any integral
one, and the output will occupy the same number of bits as the input.

C<toLOWER_L1> and C<toLOWER_LATIN1> are synonyms of each other.  They behave
identically as C<toLOWER> for ASCII-range input.  But additionally will return
the lowercase of any uppercase code point in the entire 0..255 range, assuming
a Latin-1 encoding (or the EBCDIC equivalent on such platforms).

C<toLOWER_LC> returns the lowercase of the input code point according to the
rules of the current POSIX locale.  Input code points outside the range 0..255
are returned unchanged.

C<toLOWER_uvchr> returns the lowercase of any Unicode code point.  The return
value is identical to that of C<toLOWER_L1> for input code points in the 0..255
range.  The lowercase of the vast majority of Unicode code points is the same
as the code point itself.  For these, and for code points above the legal
Unicode maximum, this returns the input code point unchanged.  It additionally
stores the UTF-8 of the result into the buffer beginning at C<s>, and its
length in bytes into C<*lenp>.  The caller must have made C<s> large enough to
contain at least C<UTF8_MAXBYTES_CASE+1> bytes to avoid possible overflow.

NOTE: the lowercase of a code point may be more than one code point.  The
return value of this function is only the first of these.  The entire lowercase
is returned in C<s>.  To determine if the result is more than a single code
point, you can do something like this:

 uc = toLOWER_uvchr(cp, s, &len);
 if (len > UTF8SKIP(s)) { is multiple code points }
 else { is a single code point }

C<toLOWER_utf8> and C<toLOWER_utf8_safe> are synonyms of each other.  The only
difference between these and C<toLOWER_uvchr> is that the source for these is
encoded in UTF-8, instead of being a code point.  It is passed as a buffer
starting at C<p>, with C<e> pointing to one byte beyond its end.  The C<p>
buffer may certainly contain more than one code point; but only the first one
(up through S<C<e - 1>>) is examined.  If the UTF-8 for the input character is
malformed in some way, the program may croak, or the function may return the
REPLACEMENT CHARACTER, at the discretion of the implementation, and subject to
change in future releases.

=head1 Character classification


This section is about functions (really macros) that classify characters
into types, such as punctuation versus alphabetic, etc.  Most of these are
analogous to regular expression character classes.  (See
L<perlrecharclass/POSIX Character Classes>.)  There are several variants for
each class.  (Not all macros have all variants; each item below lists the
ones valid for it.)  None are affected by C<use bytes>, and only the ones
with C<LC> in the name are affected by the current locale.

The base function, e.g., C<isALPHA()>, takes any signed or unsigned value,
treating it as a code point, and returns a boolean as to whether or not the
character represented by it is (or on non-ASCII platforms, corresponds to) an
ASCII character in the named class based on platform, Unicode, and Perl rules.
If the input is a number that doesn't fit in an octet, FALSE is returned.

Variant C<isI<FOO>_A> (e.g., C<isALPHA_A()>) is identical to the base function
with no suffix C<"_A">.  This variant is used to emphasize by its name that
only ASCII-range characters can return TRUE.

Variant C<isI<FOO>_L1> imposes the Latin-1 (or EBCDIC equivalent) character set
onto the platform.  That is, the code points that are ASCII are unaffected,
since ASCII is a subset of Latin-1.  But the non-ASCII code points are treated
as if they are Latin-1 characters.  For example, C<isWORDCHAR_L1()> will return
true when called with the code point 0xDF, which is a word character in both
ASCII and EBCDIC (though it represents different characters in each).
If the input is a number that doesn't fit in an octet, FALSE is returned.
(Perl's documentation uses a colloquial definition of Latin-1, to include all
code points below 256.)

Variant C<isI<FOO>_uvchr> is exactly like the C<isI<FOO>_L1> variant, for
inputs below 256, but if the code point is larger than 255, Unicode rules are
used to determine if it is in the character class.  For example,
C<isWORDCHAR_uvchr(0x100)> returns TRUE, since 0x100 is LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A
WITH MACRON in Unicode, and is a word character.

Variants C<isI<FOO>_utf8> and C<isI<FOO>_utf8_safe> are like C<isI<FOO>_uvchr>,
but are used for UTF-8 encoded strings.  The two forms are different names for
the same thing.  Each call to one of these classifies the first character of
the string starting at C<p>.  The second parameter, C<e>, points to anywhere in
the string beyond the first character, up to one byte past the end of the
entire string.  Although both variants are identical, the suffix C<_safe> in
one name emphasizes that it will not attempt to read beyond S<C<e - 1>>,
provided that the constraint S<C<s E<lt> e>> is true (this is asserted for in
C<-DDEBUGGING> builds).  If the UTF-8 for the input character is malformed in
some way, the program may croak, or the function may return FALSE, at the
discretion of the implementation, and subject to change in future releases.

Variant C<isI<FOO>_LC> is like the C<isI<FOO>_A> and C<isI<FOO>_L1> variants,
but the result is based on the current locale, which is what C<LC> in the name
stands for.  If Perl can determine that the current locale is a UTF-8 locale,
it uses the published Unicode rules; otherwise, it uses the C library function
that gives the named classification.  For example, C<isDIGIT_LC()> when not in
a UTF-8 locale returns the result of calling C<isdigit()>.  FALSE is always
returned if the input won't fit into an octet.  On some platforms where the C
library function is known to be defective, Perl changes its result to follow
the POSIX standard's rules.

Variant C<isI<FOO>_LC_uvchr> acts exactly like C<isI<FOO>_LC> for inputs less
than 256, but for larger ones it returns the Unicode classification of the code
point.

Variants C<isI<FOO>_LC_utf8> and C<isI<FOO>_LC_utf8_safe> are like
C<isI<FOO>_LC_uvchr>, but are used for UTF-8 encoded strings.  The two forms
are different names for the same thing.  Each call to one of these classifies
the first character of the string starting at C<p>.  The second parameter,
C<e>, points to anywhere in the string beyond the first character, up to one
byte past the end of the entire string.  Although both variants are identical,
the suffix C<_safe> in one name emphasizes that it will not attempt to read
beyond S<C<e - 1>>, provided that the constraint S<C<s E<lt> e>> is true (this
is asserted for in C<-DDEBUGGING> builds).  If the UTF-8 for the input
character is malformed in some way, the program may croak, or the function may
return FALSE, at the discretion of the implementation, and subject to change in
future releases.

Starting in 5.18, this is identical in all its forms to the

The locale forms of this macro are identical to their corresponding
C<isSPACE()> forms in all Perl releases.  In releases prior to 5.18, the
non-locale forms differ from their C<isSPACE()> forms only in that the
C<isSPACE()> forms don't match a Vertical Tab, and the C<isPSXSPC()> forms do.
Otherwise they are identical.  Thus this macro is analogous to what

locale forms of this macro (the ones with C<LC> in their names) matched
precisely what C<m/[[:space:]]/> does.  In those releases, the only difference,
in the non-locale variants, was that C<isSPACE()> did not match a vertical tab.

C<ASSUME> is like C<assert()>, but it has a benefit in a release build. It is a
hint to a compiler about a statement of fact in a function call free
expression, which allows the compiler to generate better machine code.  In a
debug build, C<ASSUME(x)> is a synonym for C<assert(x)>. C<ASSUME(0)> means the
control path is unreachable. In a for loop, C<ASSUME> can be used to hint that
a loop will run at least X times. C<ASSUME> is based off MSVC's C<__assume>
intrinsic function, see its documents for more details.

=item C<PERL_UNUSED_RESULT>
X<PERL_UNUSED_RESULT>

This macro indicates to discard the return value of the function call inside
it, I<e.g.>,

 PERL_UNUSED_RESULT(foo(a, b))

The main reason for this is that the combination of C<gcc -Wunused-result>
(part of C<-Wall>) and the C<__attribute__((warn_unused_result))> cannot
be silenced with casting to C<void>.  This causes trouble when the system
header files use the attribute.

Use C<PERL_UNUSED_RESULT> sparingly, though, since usually the warning
is there for a good reason: you might lose success/failure information,
or leak resources, or changes in resources.

But sometimes you just want to ignore the return value, I<e.g.>, on
codepaths soon ending up in abort, or in "best effort" attempts,
or in situations where there is no good way to handle failures.

Sometimes C<PERL_UNUSED_RESULT> might not be the most natural way:
another possibility is that you can capture the return value
and use C<L</PERL_UNUSED_VAR>> on that.

Stores a value, associated with a key, in the cop hints hash C<cophh>,
and returns the modified hash.  The returned hash pointer is in general
not the same as the hash pointer that was passed in.  The input hash is
consumed by the function, and the pointer to it must not be subsequently
used.  Use L</cophh_copy> if you need both hashes.

The key is specified by C<keypv> and C<keylen>.  If C<flags> has the

hash of the key string, or zero if it has not been precomputed.

C<value> is the scalar value to store for this key.  C<value> is copied
by this function, which thus does not take ownership of any reference
to it, and later changes to the scalar will not be reflected in the
value visible in the cop hints hash.  Complex types of scalar will not
be stored with referential integrity, but will be coerced to strings.

The XSUB-writer's equivalent of L<caller()|perlfunc/caller>.  The

information returned to Perl by C<caller>.  Note that XSUBs don't get a
stack frame, so C<caller_cx(0, NULL)> will return information for the
immediately-surrounding Perl code.

This function skips over the automatic calls to C<&DB::sub> made on the
behalf of the debugger.  If the stack frame requested was a sub called by
C<DB::sub>, the return value will be the frame for the call to
C<DB::sub>, since that has the correct line number/etc. for the call
site.  If I<dbcxp> is non-C<NULL>, it will be set to a pointer to the
frame for the sub call itself.

exist then it will be declared (which has the same effect as saying
C<sub name;>).  If C<GV_ADD> is not set and the subroutine does not exist,
then NULL is returned.

The forms differ only in how the subroutine is specified..  With C<get_cvs>,
the name is a literal C string, enclosed in double quotes.  With C<get_cv>, the
name is given by the C<name> parameter, which must be a NUL-terminated C

parameter, but it is a Perl string (possibly containing embedded NUL bytes),
and its length in bytes is contained in the C<len> parameter.

X<get_c_backtrace_dump>

Returns a SV containing a dump of C<depth> frames of the call stack, skipping
the C<skip> innermost ones.  C<depth> of 20 is usually enough.

The appended output looks like:

 ...
 1   10e004812:0082   Perl_croak   util.c:1716    /usr/bin/perl
 2   10df8d6d2:1d72   perl_parse   perl.c:3975    /usr/bin/perl
 ...

The fields are tab-separated.  The first column is the depth (zero
being the innermost non-skipped frame).  In the hex:offset, the hex is
where the program counter was in C<S_parse_body>, and the :offset (might
be missing) tells how much inside the C<S_parse_body> the program counter was.

The C<util.c:1716> is the source code file and line number.

The F</usr/bin/perl> is obvious (hopefully).

Unknowns are C<"-">.  Unknowns can happen unfortunately quite easily:
if the platform doesn't support retrieving the information;
if the binary is missing the debug information;
if the optimizer has transformed the code by for example inlining.

These take a sprintf-style format pattern and conventional

    (char *) Perl_form(pTHX_ const char* pat, ...)

can be used any place a string (char *) is required:

    char * s = Perl_form("%d.%d",major,minor);

They use a single (per-thread) private buffer so if you want to format several
strings you must explicitly copy the earlier strings away (and free the copies
when you are done).

The two forms differ only in that C<form_nocontext> does not take a thread
context (C<aTHX>) parameter, so is used in situations where the caller doesn't
already have the thread context.

Expands a message, intended for the user, to include an indication of

to be complete.

C<basemsg> is the initial message or object.  If it is a reference, it
will be used as-is and will be the result of this function.  Otherwise it
is used as a string, and if it already ends with a newline, it is taken
to be complete, and the result of this function will be the same string.
If the message does not end with a newline, then a segment such as C<at
foo.pl line 37> will be appended, and possibly other clauses indicating
the current state of execution.  The resulting message will end with a
dot and a newline.

Normally, the resulting message is returned in a new mortal SV.
During global destruction a single SV may be shared between uses of this
function.  If C<consume> is true, then the function is permitted (but not
required) to modify and return C<basemsg> instead of allocating a new SV.

=item C<pv_escape>
X<pv_escape>

Escapes at most the first C<count> chars of C<pv> and puts the results into
C<dsv> such that the size of the escaped string will not exceed C<max> chars
and will not contain any incomplete escape sequences.  The number of bytes
escaped will be returned in the C<STRLEN *escaped> parameter if it is not null.
When the C<dsv> parameter is null no escaping actually occurs, but the number
of bytes that would be escaped were it not null will be calculated.

If flags contains C<PERL_PV_ESCAPE_QUOTE> then any double quotes in the string
will also be escaped.

Normally the SV will be cleared before the escaped string is prepared,
but when C<PERL_PV_ESCAPE_NOCLEAR> is set this will not occur.

If C<PERL_PV_ESCAPE_UNI> is set then the input string is treated as UTF-8
if C<PERL_PV_ESCAPE_UNI_DETECT> is set then the input string is scanned
using C<is_utf8_string()> to determine if it is UTF-8.

If C<PERL_PV_ESCAPE_ALL> is set then all input chars will be output
using C<\x01F1> style escapes, otherwise if C<PERL_PV_ESCAPE_NONASCII> is set, only
non-ASCII chars will be escaped using this style; otherwise, only chars above
255 will be so escaped; other non printable chars will use octal or
common escaped patterns like C<\n>.
Otherwise, if C<PERL_PV_ESCAPE_NOBACKSLASH>
then all chars below 255 will be treated as printable and
will be output as literals.

If C<PERL_PV_ESCAPE_FIRSTCHAR> is set then only the first char of the
string will be escaped, regardless of max.  If the output is to be in hex,
then it will be returned as a plain hex
sequence.  Thus the output will either be a single char,
an octal escape sequence, a special escape like C<\n> or a hex value.

If C<PERL_PV_ESCAPE_RE> is set then the escape char used will be a C<"%"> and
not a C<"\\">.  This is because regexes very often contain backslashed
sequences, whereas C<"%"> is not a particularly common character in patterns.

Returns a pointer to the escaped text as held by C<dsv>.

Converts a string into something presentable, handling escaping via

double quoted with any double quotes in the string escaped.  Otherwise
if the C<PERL_PV_PRETTY_LTGT> flag is set then the result be wrapped in
angle brackets. 

If the C<PERL_PV_PRETTY_ELLIPSES> flag is set and not all characters in
string were output then an ellipsis C<...> will be appended to the
string.  Note that this happens AFTER it has been quoted.

If C<start_color> is non-null then it will be inserted after the opening
quote (if there is one) but before the escaped text.  If C<end_color>
is non-null then it will be inserted after the escaped text but before
any quotes or ellipses.

X<load_module>

Loads the module whose name is pointed to by the string part of C<name>.
Note that the actual module name, not its filename, should be given.
Eg, "Foo::Bar" instead of "Foo/Bar.pm". ver, if specified and not NULL,
provides version semantics similar to C<use Foo::Bar VERSION>. The optional
trailing arguments can be used to specify arguments to the module's C<import()>
method, similar to C<use Foo::Bar VERSION LIST>; their precise handling depends
on the flags. The flags argument is a bitwise-ORed collection of any of
C<PERL_LOADMOD_DENY>, C<PERL_LOADMOD_NOIMPORT>, or C<PERL_LOADMOD_IMPORT_OPS>
(or 0 for no flags).

If C<PERL_LOADMOD_NOIMPORT> is set, the module is loaded as if with an empty
import list, as in C<use Foo::Bar ()>; this is the only circumstance in which
the trailing optional arguments may be omitted entirely. Otherwise, if
C<PERL_LOADMOD_IMPORT_OPS> is set, the trailing arguments must consist of
exactly one C<OP*>, containing the op tree that produces the relevant import
arguments. Otherwise, the trailing arguments must all be C<SV*> values that
will be used as import arguments; and the list must be terminated with C<(SV*)
NULL>. If neither C<PERL_LOADMOD_NOIMPORT> nor C<PERL_LOADMOD_IMPORT_OPS> is
set, the trailing C<NULL> pointer is needed even if no import arguments are
desired. The reference count for each specified C<SV*> argument is
decremented. In addition, the C<name> argument is modified.

If C<PERL_LOADMOD_DENY> is set, the module is loaded as if with C<no> rather
than C<use>.

without it we only clone the data and zero the stacks,
with it we copy the stacks and the new perl interpreter is
ready to run at the exact same point as the previous one.
The pseudo-fork code uses C<COPY_STACKS> while the
threads->create doesn't.

C<CLONEf_KEEP_PTR_TABLE> -
C<perl_clone> keeps a ptr_table with the pointer of the old
variable as a key and the new variable as a value,
this allows it to check if something has been cloned and not
clone it again, but rather just use the value and increase the
refcount.
If C<KEEP_PTR_TABLE> is not set then C<perl_clone> will kill the ptr_table

A reason to keep it around is if you want to dup some of your own
variables which are outside the graph that perl scans.

C<CLONEf_CLONE_HOST> -
This is a win32 thing, it is ignored on unix, it tells perl's
win32host code (which is c++) to clone itself, this is needed on
win32 if you want to run two threads at the same time,
if you just want to do some stuff in a separate perl interpreter
and then throw it away and return to the original one,
you don't need to do anything.

Shuts down a Perl interpreter.  See L<perlembed> for a tutorial.

C<my_perl> points to the Perl interpreter.  It must have been previously
created through the use of L</perl_alloc> and L</perl_construct>.  It may
have been initialised through L</perl_parse>, and may have been used
through L</perl_run> and other means.  This function should be called for
any Perl interpreter that has been constructed with L</perl_construct>,
even if subsequent operations on it failed, for example if L</perl_parse>
returned a non-zero value.

If the interpreter's C<PL_exit_flags> word has the
C<PERL_EXIT_DESTRUCT_END> flag set, then this function will execute code
in C<END> blocks before performing the rest of destruction.  If it is
desired to make any use of the interpreter between L</perl_parse> and
L</perl_destruct> other than just calling L</perl_run>, then this flag
should be set early on.  This matters if L</perl_run> will not be called,
or if anything else will be done in addition to calling L</perl_run>.

Returns a value be a suitable value to pass to the C library function
C<exit> (or to return from C<main>), to serve as an exit code indicating
the nature of the way the interpreter terminated.  This takes into account
any failure of L</perl_parse> and any early exit from L</perl_run>.
The exit code is of the type required by the host operating system,
so because of differing exit code conventions it is not portable to
interpret specific numeric values as having specific meanings.

=item C<perl_parse>
X<perl_parse>

Tells a Perl interpreter to parse a Perl script.  This performs most
of the initialisation of a Perl interpreter.  See L<perlembed> for
a tutorial.

C<my_perl> points to the Perl interpreter that is to parse the script.
It must have been previously created through the use of L</perl_alloc>
and L</perl_construct>.  C<xsinit> points to a callback function that
will be called to set up the ability for this Perl interpreter to load
XS extensions, or may be null to perform no such setup.

C<argc> and C<argv> supply a set of command-line arguments to the Perl
interpreter, as would normally be passed to the C<main> function of
a C program.  C<argv[argc]> must be null.  These arguments are where
the script to parse is specified, either by naming a script file or by
providing a script in a C<-e> option.
If L<C<$0>|perlvar/$0> will be written to in the Perl interpreter, then
the argument strings must be in writable memory, and so mustn't just be
string constants.

C<env> specifies a set of environment variables that will be used by
this Perl interpreter.  If non-null, it must point to a null-terminated
array of environment strings.  If null, the Perl interpreter will use
the environment supplied by the C<environ> global variable.

This function initialises the interpreter, and parses and compiles the
script specified by the command-line arguments.  This includes executing
code in C<BEGIN>, C<UNITCHECK>, and C<CHECK> blocks.  It does not execute
C<INIT> blocks or the main program.

Returns an integer of slightly tricky interpretation.  The correct
use of the return value is as a truth value indicating whether there
was a failure in initialisation.  If zero is returned, this indicates
that initialisation was successful, and it is safe to proceed to call
L</perl_run> and make other use of it.  If a non-zero value is returned,
this indicates some problem that means the interpreter wants to terminate.
The interpreter should not be just abandoned upon such failure; the caller
should proceed to shut the interpreter down cleanly with L</perl_destruct>
and free it with L</perl_free>.

For historical reasons, the non-zero return value also attempts to
be a suitable value to pass to the C library function C<exit> (or to
return from C<main>), to serve as an exit code indicating the nature
of the way initialisation terminated.  However, this isn't portable,
due to differing exit code conventions.  A historical bug is preserved
for the time being: if the Perl built-in C<exit> is called during this
function's execution, with a type of exit entailing a zero exit code
under the host operating system's conventions, then this function
returns zero rather than a non-zero value.  This bug, [perl #2754],
leads to C<perl_run> being called (and therefore C<INIT> blocks and the
main program running) despite a call to C<exit>.  It has been preserved
because a popular module-installing module has come to rely on it and
needs time to be fixed.  This issue is [perl #132577], and the original
bug is due to be fixed in Perl 5.30.

=item C<perl_run>
X<perl_run>

Tells a Perl interpreter to run its main program.  See L<perlembed>
for a tutorial.

C<my_perl> points to the Perl interpreter.  It must have been previously
created through the use of L</perl_alloc> and L</perl_construct>, and
initialised through L</perl_parse>.  This function should not be called
if L</perl_parse> returned a non-zero value, indicating a failure in
initialisation or compilation.

This function executes code in C<INIT> blocks, and then executes the
main program.  The code to be executed is that established by the prior
call to L</perl_parse>.  If the interpreter's C<PL_exit_flags> word
does not have the C<PERL_EXIT_DESTRUCT_END> flag set, then this function
will also execute code in C<END> blocks.  If it is desired to make any
further use of the interpreter after calling this function, then C<END>
blocks should be postponed to L</perl_destruct> time by setting that flag.

Returns an integer of slightly tricky interpretation.  The correct use
of the return value is as a truth value indicating whether the program
terminated non-locally.  If zero is returned, this indicates that
the program ran to completion, and it is safe to make other use of the
interpreter (provided that the C<PERL_EXIT_DESTRUCT_END> flag was set as
described above).  If a non-zero value is returned, this indicates that
the interpreter wants to terminate early.  The interpreter should not be
just abandoned because of this desire to terminate; the caller should
proceed to shut the interpreter down cleanly with L</perl_destruct>
and free it with L</perl_free>.

For historical reasons, the non-zero return value also attempts to
be a suitable value to pass to the C library function C<exit> (or to
return from C<main>), to serve as an exit code indicating the nature of
the way the program terminated.  However, this isn't portable, due to
differing exit code conventions.  An attempt is made to return an exit
code of the type required by the host operating system, but because
it is constrained to be non-zero, it is not necessarily possible to
indicate every type of exit.  It is only reliable on Unix, where a zero
exit code can be augmented with a set bit that will be ignored.  In any
case, this function is not the correct place to acquire an exit code:
one should get that from L</perl_destruct>.

=item C<sv_string_from_errnum>
X<sv_string_from_errnum>

Generates the message string describing an OS error and returns it as
an SV.  C<errnum> must be a value that C<errno> could take, identifying
the type of error.

If C<tgtsv> is non-null then the string will be written into that SV
(overwriting existing content) and it will be returned.  If C<tgtsv>
is a null pointer then the string will be written into a new mortal SV
which will be returned.

The message will be taken from whatever locale would be used by C<$!>,
and will be encoded in the SV in whatever manner would be used by C<$!>.
The details of this process are subject to future change.  Currently,
the message is taken from the C locale by default (usually producing an
English message), and from the currently selected locale when in the scope
of the C<use locale> pragma.  A heuristic attempt is made to decode the
message from the locale's character encoding, but it will only be decoded
as either UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1.  It is always correctly decoded in a UTF-8
locale, usually in an ISO-8859-1 locale, and never in any other locale.

The SV is always returned containing an actual string, and with no other
OK bits set.  Unlike C<$!>, a message is even yielded for C<errnum> zero
(meaning success), and if no useful message is available then a useless
string (currently empty) is returned.

=head2 List of capability C<HAS_I<foo>> symbols

This is a list of those symbols that dont appear elsewhere in ths
document that indicate if the current platform has a certain
capability.  Their names all begin with C<HAS_>.  Only those
symbols whose capability is directly derived from the name are
listed here.  All others have their meaning expanded out elsewhere
in this document.  This (relatively) compact list is because we
think that the expansion would add little or no value and take up
a lot of space (because there are so many).  If you think certain
ones should be expanded, send email to
L<perl5-porters@perl.org|mailto:perl5-porters@perl.org>.

Each symbol here will be C<#define>d if and only if the platform
has the capability.  If you need more detail, see the
corresponding entry in F<config.h>.  For convenience, the list is

=head1 Global Variables


These variables are global to an entire process.  They are shared between
all interpreters and all threads in a process.  Any variables not documented
here may be changed or removed without notice, so don't use them!
If you feel you really do need to use an unlisted variable, first send email to
L<perl5-porters@perl.org|mailto:perl5-porters@perl.org>.  It may be that
someone there will point out a way to accomplish what you need without using an
internal variable.  But if not, you should get a go-ahead to document and then
use the variable.

=item C<PL_check>
X<PL_check>

Array, indexed by opcode, of functions that will be called for the "check"
phase of optree building during compilation of Perl code.  For most (but
not all) types of op, once the op has been initially built and populated
with child ops it will be filtered through the check function referenced
by the appropriate element of this array.  The new op is passed in as the
sole argument to the check function, and the check function returns the
completed op.  The check function may (as the name suggests) check the op
for validity and signal errors.  It may also initialise or modify parts of
the ops, or perform more radical surgery such as adding or removing child
ops, or even throw the op away and return a different op in its place.

This array of function pointers is a convenient place to hook into the
compilation process.  An XS module can put its own custom check function
in place of any of the standard ones, to influence the compilation of a
particular type of op.  However, a custom check function must never fully
replace a standard check function (or even a custom check function from
another module).  A module modifying checking must instead B<wrap> the
preexisting check function.  A custom check function must be selective
about when to apply its custom behaviour.  In the usual case where
it decides not to do anything special with an op, it must chain the
preexisting op function.  Check functions are thus linked in a chain,
with the core's base checker at the end.

For thread safety, modules should not write directly to this array.
Instead, use the function L</wrap_op_checker>.

=item C<PL_keyword_plugin>
X<PL_keyword_plugin>

NOTE: C<PL_keyword_plugin> is B<experimental> and may change or be
removed without notice.

Function pointer, pointing at a function used to handle extended keywords.
The function should be declared as

        int keyword_plugin_function(pTHX_
                char *keyword_ptr, STRLEN keyword_len,
                OP **op_ptr)

The function is called from the tokeniser, whenever a possible keyword
is seen.  C<keyword_ptr> points at the word in the parser's input
buffer, and C<keyword_len> gives its length; it is not null-terminated.
The function is expected to examine the word, and possibly other state
such as L<%^H|perlvar/%^H>, to decide whether it wants to handle it
as an extended keyword.  If it does not, the function should return
C<KEYWORD_PLUGIN_DECLINE>, and the normal parser process will continue.

If the function wants to handle the keyword, it first must
parse anything following the keyword that is part of the syntax
introduced by the keyword.  See L</Lexer interface> for details.

When a keyword is being handled, the plugin function must build
a tree of C<OP> structures, representing the code that was parsed.
The root of the tree must be stored in C<*op_ptr>.  The function then
returns a constant indicating the syntactic role of the construct that
it has parsed: C<KEYWORD_PLUGIN_STMT> if it is a complete statement, or
C<KEYWORD_PLUGIN_EXPR> if it is an expression.  Note that a statement
construct cannot be used inside an expression (except via C<do BLOCK>
and similar), and an expression is not a complete statement (it requires
at least a terminating semicolon).

When a keyword is handled, the plugin function may also have
(compile-time) side effects.  It may modify C<%^H>, define functions, and
so on.  Typically, if side effects are the main purpose of a handler,
it does not wish to generate any ops to be included in the normal
compilation.  In this case it is still required to supply an op tree,
but it suffices to generate a single null op.

That's how the C<*PL_keyword_plugin> function needs to behave overall.
Conventionally, however, one does not completely replace the existing
handler function.  Instead, take a copy of C<PL_keyword_plugin> before
assigning your own function pointer to it.  Your handler function should
look for keywords that it is interested in and handle those.  Where it
is not interested, it should call the saved plugin function, passing on
the arguments it received.  Thus C<PL_keyword_plugin> actually points
at a chain of handler functions, all of which have an opportunity to
handle keywords, and only the last function in the chain (built into
the Perl core) will normally return C<KEYWORD_PLUGIN_DECLINE>.

For thread safety, modules should not set this variable directly.
Instead, use the function L</wrap_keyword_plugin>.

=item C<PL_phase>
X<PL_phase>

A value that indicates the current Perl interpreter's phase. Possible values
include C<PERL_PHASE_CONSTRUCT>, C<PERL_PHASE_START>, C<PERL_PHASE_CHECK>,
C<PERL_PHASE_INIT>, C<PERL_PHASE_RUN>, C<PERL_PHASE_END>, and
C<PERL_PHASE_DESTRUCT>.

For example, the following determines whether the interpreter is in
global destruction:

    if (PL_phase == PERL_PHASE_DESTRUCT) {
        // we are in global destruction
    }

C<PL_phase> was introduced in Perl 5.14; in prior perls you can use
C<PL_dirty> (boolean) to determine whether the interpreter is in global
destruction. (Use of C<PL_dirty> is discouraged since 5.14.)

=head1 GV Handling


A GV is a structure which corresponds to to a Perl typeglob, ie *foo.
It is a structure that holds a pointer to a scalar, an array, a hash etc,
corresponding to $foo, @foo, %foo.

GVs are usually found as values in stashes (symbol table hashes) where
Perl stores its global variables.

=item C<gv_fetchfile_flags>
X<gv_fetchfile>X<gv_fetchfile_flags>

These return the debugger glob for the file (compiled by Perl) whose name is
given by the C<name> parameter.

There are currently exactly two differences between these functions.

The C<name> parameter to C<gv_fetchfile> is a C string, meaning it is
C<NUL>-terminated; whereas the C<name> parameter to C<gv_fetchfile_flags> is a
Perl string, whose length (in bytes) is passed in via the C<namelen> parameter
This means the name may contain embedded C<NUL> characters.
C<namelen> doesn't exist in plain C<gv_fetchfile>).

The other difference is that C<gv_fetchfile_flags> has an extra C<flags>
parameter, which is currently completely ignored, but allows for possible
future extensions.

=item C<gv_fetchmethod_autoload>
X<gv_fetchmethod_autoload>

Returns the glob which contains the subroutine to call to invoke the method
on the C<stash>.  In fact in the presence of autoloading this may be the
glob for "AUTOLOAD".  In this case the corresponding variable C<$AUTOLOAD> is
already setup.

The third parameter of C<gv_fetchmethod_autoload> determines whether
AUTOLOAD lookup is performed if the given method is not present: non-zero
means yes, look for AUTOLOAD; zero means no, don't look for AUTOLOAD.
Calling C<gv_fetchmethod> is equivalent to calling C<gv_fetchmethod_autoload>
with a non-zero C<autoload> parameter.

These functions grant C<"SUPER"> token
as a prefix of the method name.  Note
that if you want to keep the returned glob for a long time, you need to
check for it being "AUTOLOAD", since at the later time the call may load a
different subroutine due to C<$AUTOLOAD> changing its value.  Use the glob
created as a side effect to do this.

These functions have the same side-effects as C<gv_fetchmeth> with
C<level==0>.  The warning against passing the GV returned by
C<gv_fetchmeth> to C<call_sv> applies equally to these functions.

=item C<gv_fetchmeth_pvn>
X<gv_fetchmeth_pvn>

Returns the glob with the given C<name> and a defined subroutine or
C<NULL>.  The glob lives in the given C<stash>, or in the stashes
accessible via C<@ISA> and C<UNIVERSAL::>.

The argument C<level> should be either 0 or -1.  If C<level==0>, as a
side-effect creates a glob with the given C<name> in the given C<stash>
which in the case of success contains an alias for the subroutine, and sets
up caching info for this glob.

The only significant values for C<flags> are C<GV_SUPER>, C<GV_NOUNIVERSAL>, and
C<SVf_UTF8>.

C<GV_SUPER> indicates that we want to look up the method in the superclasses
of the C<stash>.

C<GV_NOUNIVERSAL> indicates that we do not want to look up the method in
the stash accessible by C<UNIVERSAL::>.

The
GV returned from C<gv_fetchmeth> may be a method cache entry, which is not
visible to Perl code.  So when calling C<call_sv>, you should not use
the GV directly; instead, you should use the method's CV, which can be
obtained from the GV with the C<GvCV> macro.

Don't be fooled by the fact that only one form has C<flags> in its name.  They
all have a C<flags> parameter in fact, and all the flag bits have the same
meanings for all

If any of the flags C<GV_ADD>, C<GV_ADDMG>, C<GV_ADDWARN>, C<GV_ADDMULTI>, or
C<GV_NOINIT> is set, a GV is created if none already exists for the input name
and type.  However, C<GV_ADDMG> will only do the creation for magical GV's.
For all of these flags except C<GV_NOINIT>, C<L</gv_init_pvn>> is called after
the addition.  C<GV_ADDWARN> is used when the caller expects that adding won't
be necessary because the symbol should already exist; but if not, add it
anyway, with a warning that it was unexpectedly absent.  The C<GV_ADDMULTI>
flag means to pretend that the GV has been seen before (I<i.e.>, suppress "Used
once" warnings).

The flag C<GV_NOADD_NOINIT> causes C<L</gv_init_pvn>> not be to called if the
GV existed but isn't PVGV.

If the C<SVf_UTF8> bit is set, the name is treated as being encoded in UTF-8;
otherwise the name won't be considered to be UTF-8 in the C<pv>-named forms,
and the UTF-8ness of the underlying SVs will be used in the C<sv> forms.

If the flag C<GV_NOTQUAL> is set, the caller warrants that the input name is a
plain symbol name, not qualified with a package, otherwise the name is checked
for being a qualified one.

In C<gv_fetchpv>, C<nambeg> is a C string, NUL-terminated with no intermediate
NULs.

In C<gv_fetchpvs>, C<name> is a literal C string, hence is enclosed in
double quotes.

C<gv_fetchpvn> and C<gv_fetchpvn_flags> are identical.  In these, <nambeg> is
a Perl string whose byte length is given by C<full_len>, and may contain
embedded NULs.

In C<gv_fetchsv> and C<gv_fetchsv_nomg>, the name is extracted from the PV of
the input C<name> SV.  The only difference between these two forms is that
'get' magic is normally done on C<name> in C<gv_fetchsv>, and always skipped
with C<gv_fetchsv_nomg>.  Including C<GV_NO_SVGMAGIC> in the C<flags> parameter
to C<gv_fetchsv> makes it behave identically to C<gv_fetchsv_nomg>.

X<gv_init_pvn>

Converts a scalar into a typeglob.  This is an incoercible typeglob;
assigning a reference to it will assign to one of its slots, instead of
overwriting it as happens with typeglobs created by C<SvSetSV>.  Converting
any scalar that is C<SvOK()> may produce unpredictable results and is reserved
for perl's internal use.

C<gv> is the scalar to be converted.

C<stash> is the parent stash/package, if any.

C<name> and C<len> give the name.  The name must be unqualified;
that is, it must not include the package name.  If C<gv> is a
stash element, it is the caller's responsibility to ensure that the name
passed to this function matches the name of the element.  If it does not
match, perl's internal bookkeeping will get out of sync.

C<flags> can be set to C<SVf_UTF8> if C<name> is a UTF-8 string, or
the return value of SvUTF8(sv).  It can also take the
C<GV_ADDMULTI> flag, which means to pretend that the GV has been

=head1 Hook manipulation


These functions provide convenient and thread-safe means of manipulating
hook variables.


=over 4

=item C<wrap_op_checker>
X<wrap_op_checker>

Puts a C function into the chain of check functions for a specified op
type.  This is the preferred way to manipulate the L</PL_check> array.
C<opcode> specifies which type of op is to be affected.  C<new_checker>
is a pointer to the C function that is to be added to that opcode's
check chain, and C<old_checker_p> points to the storage location where a
pointer to the next function in the chain will be stored.  The value of
C<new_checker> is written into the L</PL_check> array, while the value
previously stored there is written to C<*old_checker_p>.

L</PL_check> is global to an entire process, and a module wishing to
hook op checking may find itself invoked more than once per process,
typically in different threads.  To handle that situation, this function
is idempotent.  The location C<*old_checker_p> must initially (once
per process) contain a null pointer.  A C variable of static duration
(declared at file scope, typically also marked C<static> to give
it internal linkage) will be implicitly initialised appropriately,
if it does not have an explicit initialiser.  This function will only
actually modify the check chain if it finds C<*old_checker_p> to be null.
This function is also thread safe on the small scale.  It uses appropriate
locking to avoid race conditions in accessing L</PL_check>.

When this function is called, the function referenced by C<new_checker>
must be ready to be called, except for C<*old_checker_p> being unfilled.
In a threading situation, C<new_checker> may be called immediately,
even before this function has returned.  C<*old_checker_p> will always
be appropriately set before C<new_checker> is called.  If C<new_checker>
decides not to do anything special with an op that it is given (which
is the usual case for most uses of op check hooking), it must chain the
check function referenced by C<*old_checker_p>.

Taken all together, XS code to hook an op checker should typically look
something like this:

    static Perl_check_t nxck_frob;
    static OP *myck_frob(pTHX_ OP *op) {
	...
	op = nxck_frob(aTHX_ op);
	...
	return op;
    }
    BOOT:
	wrap_op_checker(OP_FROB, myck_frob, &nxck_frob);

If you want to influence compilation of calls to a specific subroutine,
then use L</cv_set_call_checker_flags> rather than hooking checking of
all C<entersub> ops.

=head1 HV Handling


A HV structure represents a Perl hash.  It consists mainly of an array
of pointers, each of which points to a linked list of HE structures.  The
array is indexed by the hash function of the key, so each linked list
represents all the hash entries with the same hash value.  Each HE contains
a pointer to the actual value, plus a pointer to a HEK structure which
holds the key and hash value.


=over 4

=item C<get_hv>
X<get_hv>

Returns the HV of the specified Perl hash.  C<flags> are passed to
C<gv_fetchpv>.  If C<GV_ADD> is set and the

and the variable does not exist then C<NULL> is returned.

not care about what the length of the key is, you may use the global
variable C<PL_na>, though this is rather less efficient than using a local
variable.  Remember though, that hash keys in perl are free to contain
embedded nulls, so using C<strlen()> or similar is not a good way to find
the length of hash keys.  This is very similar to the C<SvPV()> macro
described elsewhere in this document.  See also C<L</HeUTF8>>.

If you are using C<HePV> to get values to pass to C<newSVpvn()> to create a
new SV, you should consider using C<newSVhek(HeKEY_hek(he))> as it is more
efficient.

=item C<hv_fill>
X<hv_fill>

Returns the number of hash buckets that happen to be in use.

This function is wrapped by the macro C<HvFILL>.

As of perl 5.25 this function is used only for debugging
purposes, and the number of used hash buckets is not
in any way cached, thus this function can be costly
to execute as it must iterate over all the buckets in the
hash.

NOTE: C<hv_fill> must be explicitly called as
C<Perl_hv_fill>
with an C<aTHX_> parameter.

Prepares a starting point to traverse a hash table.  Returns the number of
keys in the hash, including placeholders (i.e. the same as C<HvTOTALKEYS(hv)>).
The return value is currently only meaningful for hashes without tie magic.

NOTE: Before version 5.004_65, C<hv_iterinit> used to return the number of
hash buckets that happen to be in use.  If you still need that esoteric
value, you can get it through the macro C<HvFILL(hv)>.

You may call C<hv_delete> or C<hv_delete_ent> on the hash entry that the
iterator currently points to, without losing your place or invalidating your
iterator.  Note that in this case the current entry is deleted from the hash
with your iterator holding the last reference to it.  Your iterator is flagged
to free the entry on the next call to C<hv_iternext>, so you must not discard
your iterator immediately else the entry will leak - call C<hv_iternext> to
trigger the resource deallocation.

Returns entries from a hash iterator.  See C<L</hv_iterinit>> and
C<L</hv_iternext>>.
The C<flags> value will normally be zero; if C<HV_ITERNEXT_WANTPLACEHOLDERS> is
set the placeholders keys (for restricted hashes) will be returned in addition
to normal keys.  By default placeholders are automatically skipped over.
Currently a placeholder is implemented with a value that is
C<&PL_sv_placeholder>.  Note that the implementation of placeholders and
restricted hashes may change, and the implementation currently is
insufficiently abstracted for any change to be tidy.

=item C<hv_store>
X<hv_store>

Stores an SV in a hash.  The hash key is specified as C<key> and the
absolute value of C<klen> is the length of the key.  If C<klen> is
negative the key is assumed to be in UTF-8-encoded Unicode.  The
C<hash> parameter is the precomputed hash value; if it is zero then
Perl will compute it.

The return value will be
C<NULL> if the operation failed or if the value did not need to be actually
stored within the hash (as in the case of tied hashes).  Otherwise it can
be dereferenced to get the original C<SV*>.  Note that the caller is
responsible for suitably incrementing the reference count of C<val> before
the call, and decrementing it if the function returned C<NULL>.  Effectively
a successful C<hv_store> takes ownership of one reference to C<val>.  This is
usually what you want; a newly created SV has a reference count of one, so
if all your code does is create SVs then store them in a hash, C<hv_store>
will own the only reference to the new SV, and your code doesn't need to do
anything further to tidy up.  C<hv_store> is not implemented as a call to
C<hv_store_ent>, and does not create a temporary SV for the key, so if your
key data is not already in SV form then use C<hv_store> in preference to
C<hv_store_ent>.

See L<perlguts/"Understanding the Magic of Tied Hashes and Arrays"> for more
information on how to use this function on tied hashes.

X<hv_store_ent>

Stores C<val> in a hash.  The hash key is specified as C<key>.  The C<hash>
parameter is the precomputed hash value; if it is zero then Perl will
compute it.  The return value is the new hash entry so created.  It will be
C<NULL> if the operation failed or if the value did not need to be actually
stored within the hash (as in the case of tied hashes).  Otherwise the
contents of the return value can be accessed using the C<He?> macros
described here.  Note that the caller is responsible for suitably
incrementing the reference count of C<val> before the call, and
decrementing it if the function returned NULL.  Effectively a successful
C<hv_store_ent> takes ownership of one reference to C<val>.  This is
usually what you want; a newly created SV has a reference count of one, so
if all your code does is create SVs then store them in a hash, C<hv_store>
will own the only reference to the new SV, and your code doesn't need to do
anything further to tidy up.  Note that C<hv_store_ent> only reads the C<key>;
unlike C<val> it does not take ownership of it, so maintaining the correct
reference count on C<key> is entirely the caller's responsibility.  The reason
it does not take ownership, is that C<key> is not used after this function
returns, and so can be freed immediately.  C<hv_store>
is not implemented as a call to C<hv_store_ent>, and does not create a temporary
SV for the key, so if your key data is not already in SV form then use
C<hv_store> in preference to C<hv_store_ent>.

to share data among each other.  It is a good idea to use keys
prefixed by the package name of the extension that owns the data.

On threaded perls, each thread has an independent copy of this variable;
each initialized at creation time with the current value of the creating

X<lex_bufutf8>

NOTE: C<lex_bufutf8> is B<experimental> and may change or be

Indicates whether the octets in the lexer buffer
(L</PL_parser-E<gt>linestr>) should be interpreted as the UTF-8 encoding
of Unicode characters.  If not, they should be interpreted as Latin-1
characters.  This is analogous to the C<SvUTF8> flag for scalars.

In UTF-8 mode, it is not guaranteed that the lexer buffer actually
contains valid UTF-8.  Lexing code must be robust in the face of invalid
encoding.

The actual C<SvUTF8> flag of the L</PL_parser-E<gt>linestr> scalar
is significant, but not the whole story regarding the input character
encoding.  Normally, when a file is being read, the scalar contains octets
and its C<SvUTF8> flag is off, but the octets should be interpreted as
UTF-8 if the C<use utf8> pragma is in effect.  During a string eval,
however, the scalar may have the C<SvUTF8> flag on, and in this case its
octets should be interpreted as UTF-8 unless the C<use bytes> pragma
is in effect.  This logic may change in the future; use this function
instead of implementing the logic yourself.

all pointers into the buffer updated appropriately.  C<ptr> must not
be later in the buffer than the position of L</PL_parser-E<gt>bufptr>:
it is not permitted to discard text that has yet to be lexed.

Normally it is not necessarily to do this directly, because it suffices to
use the implicit discarding behaviour of L</lex_next_chunk> and things
based on it.  However, if a token stretches across multiple lines,
and the lexing code has kept multiple lines of text in the buffer for
that purpose, then after completion of the token it would be wise to
explicitly discard the now-unneeded earlier lines, to avoid future
multi-line tokens growing the buffer without bound.

NOTE: C<lex_next_chunk> is B<experimental> and may change or be

Reads in the next chunk of text to be lexed, appending it to
L</PL_parser-E<gt>linestr>.  This should be called when lexing code has
looked to the end of the current chunk and wants to know more.  It is
usual, but not necessary, for lexing to have consumed the entirety of
the current chunk at this time.

If L</PL_parser-E<gt>bufptr> is pointing to the very end of the current
chunk (i.e., the current chunk has been entirely consumed), normally the
current chunk will be discarded at the same time that the new chunk is
read in.  If C<flags> has the C<LEX_KEEP_PREVIOUS> bit set, the current chunk
will not be discarded.  If the current chunk has not been entirely
consumed, then it will not be discarded regardless of the flag.

Returns true if some new text was added to the buffer, or false if the

Creates and initialises a new lexer/parser state object, supplying

A pointer to the new state object is placed in L</PL_parser>.  An entry

Nothing else need be done to clean up the parsing context.

The code to be parsed comes from C<line> and C<rsfp>.  C<line>, if
non-null, provides a string (in SV form) containing code to be parsed.
A copy of the string is made, so subsequent modification of C<line>
does not affect parsing.  C<rsfp>, if non-null, provides an input stream
from which code will be read to be parsed.  If both are non-null, the
code in C<line> comes first and must consist of complete lines of input,
and C<rsfp> supplies the remainder of the source.

The C<flags> parameter is reserved for future use.  Currently it is only

X<parse_arithexpr>

NOTE: C<parse_arithexpr> is B<experimental> and may change or be
removed without notice.

Parse a Perl arithmetic expression.  This may contain operators of precedence
down to the bit shift operators.  The expression must be followed (and thus
terminated) either by a comparison or lower-precedence operator or by
something that would normally terminate an expression such as semicolon.
If C<flags> has the C<PARSE_OPTIONAL> bit set, then the expression is optional,
otherwise it is mandatory.  It is up to the caller to ensure that the
dynamic parser state (L</PL_parser> et al) is correctly set to reflect
the source of the code to be parsed and the lexical context for the
expression.

The op tree representing the expression is returned.  If an optional
expression is absent, a null pointer is returned, otherwise the pointer
will be non-null.

If an error occurs in parsing or compilation, in most cases a valid op
tree is returned anyway.  The error is reflected in the parser state,
normally resulting in a single exception at the top level of parsing
which covers all the compilation errors that occurred.  Some compilation
errors, however, will throw an exception immediately.

Parse a single unadorned Perl statement.  This may be a normal imperative
statement or a declaration that has compile-time effect.  It does not
include any label or other affixture.  It is up to the caller to ensure
that the dynamic parser state (L</PL_parser> et al) is correctly set to
reflect the source of the code to be parsed and the lexical context for
the statement.

The op tree representing the statement is returned.  This may be a
null pointer if the statement is null, for example if it was actually
a subroutine definition (which has compile-time side effects).  If not
null, it will be ops directly implementing the statement, suitable to

imperative statements, including optional labels, or declarations
that have compile-time effect, or any mixture thereof.  The statement
sequence ends when a closing brace or end-of-file is encountered in a
place where a new statement could have validly started.  It is up to

Lexing code (whether in the Perl core or not) moves this pointer past
the characters that it consumes.  It is also expected to perform some
bookkeeping whenever a newline character is consumed.  This movement
can be more conveniently performed by the function L</lex_read_to>,

Buffer scalar containing the chunk currently under consideration of the
text currently being lexed.  This is always a plain string scalar (for
which C<SvPOK> is true).  It is not intended to be used as a scalar by
normal scalar means; instead refer to the buffer directly by the pointer
variables described below.

The lexer maintains various C<char*> pointers to things in the
C<PL_parser-E<gt>linestr> buffer.  If C<PL_parser-E<gt>linestr> is ever
reallocated, all of these pointers must be updated.  Don't attempt to
do this manually, but rather use L</lex_grow_linestr> if you need to
reallocate the buffer.

The content of the text chunk in the buffer is commonly exactly one
complete line of input, up to and including a newline terminator,
but there are situations where it is otherwise.  The octets of the
buffer may be intended to be interpreted as either UTF-8 or Latin-1.
The function L</lex_bufutf8> tells you which.  Do not use the C<SvUTF8>
flag on this scalar, which may disagree with it.

For direct examination of the buffer, the variable
L</PL_parser-E<gt>bufend> points to the end of the buffer.  The current
lexing position is pointed to by L</PL_parser-E<gt>bufptr>.  Direct use
of these pointers is usually preferable to examination of the scalar
through normal scalar means.

=item C<wrap_keyword_plugin>
X<wrap_keyword_plugin>

NOTE: C<wrap_keyword_plugin> is B<experimental> and may change or be
removed without notice.

Puts a C function into the chain of keyword plugins.  This is the
preferred way to manipulate the L</PL_keyword_plugin> variable.
C<new_plugin> is a pointer to the C function that is to be added to the
keyword plugin chain, and C<old_plugin_p> points to the storage location
where a pointer to the next function in the chain will be stored.  The
value of C<new_plugin> is written into the L</PL_keyword_plugin> variable,
while the value previously stored there is written to C<*old_plugin_p>.

L</PL_keyword_plugin> is global to an entire process, and a module wishing
to hook keyword parsing may find itself invoked more than once per
process, typically in different threads.  To handle that situation, this
function is idempotent.  The location C<*old_plugin_p> must initially
(once per process) contain a null pointer.  A C variable of static
duration (declared at file scope, typically also marked C<static> to give
it internal linkage) will be implicitly initialised appropriately, if it
does not have an explicit initialiser.  This function will only actually
modify the plugin chain if it finds C<*old_plugin_p> to be null.  This
function is also thread safe on the small scale.  It uses appropriate
locking to avoid race conditions in accessing L</PL_keyword_plugin>.

When this function is called, the function referenced by C<new_plugin>
must be ready to be called, except for C<*old_plugin_p> being unfilled.
In a threading situation, C<new_plugin> may be called immediately, even
before this function has returned.  C<*old_plugin_p> will always be
appropriately set before C<new_plugin> is called.  If C<new_plugin>
decides not to do anything special with the identifier that it is given
(which is the usual case for most calls to a keyword plugin), it must
chain the plugin function referenced by C<*old_plugin_p>.

Taken all together, XS code to install a keyword plugin should typically
look something like this:

    static Perl_keyword_plugin_t next_keyword_plugin;
    static OP *my_keyword_plugin(pTHX_
        char *keyword_ptr, STRLEN keyword_len, OP **op_ptr)
    {
        if (memEQs(keyword_ptr, keyword_len,
                   "my_new_keyword")) {
            ...
        } else {
            return next_keyword_plugin(aTHX_
                keyword_ptr, keyword_len, op_ptr);
        }
    }
    BOOT:
        wrap_keyword_plugin(my_keyword_plugin,
                            &next_keyword_plugin);

Direct access to L</PL_keyword_plugin> should be avoided.

X<Perl_langinfo>

This is an (almost) drop-in replacement for the system C<L<nl_langinfo(3)>>,
taking the same C<item> parameter values, and returning the same information.
But it is more thread-safe than regular C<nl_langinfo()>, and hides the quirks
of Perl's locale handling from your code, and can be used on systems that lack
a native C<nl_langinfo>.

Expanding on these:

=over

=item *

The reason it isn't quite a drop-in replacement is actually an advantage.  The
only difference is that it returns S<C<const char *>>, whereas plain
C<nl_langinfo()> returns S<C<char *>>, but you are (only by documentation)
forbidden to write into the buffer.  By declaring this C<const>, the compiler
enforces this restriction, so if it is violated, you know at compilation time,
rather than getting segfaults at runtime.

=item *

It delivers the correct results for the C<RADIXCHAR> and C<THOUSEP> items,
without you having to write extra code.  The reason for the extra code would be
because these are from the C<LC_NUMERIC> locale category, which is normally
kept set by Perl so that the radix is a dot, and the separator is the empty
string, no matter what the underlying locale is supposed to be, and so to get
the expected results, you have to temporarily toggle into the underlying
locale, and later toggle back.  (You could use plain C<nl_langinfo> and
C<L</STORE_LC_NUMERIC_FORCE_TO_UNDERLYING>> for this but then you wouldn't get
the other advantages of C<Perl_langinfo()>; not keeping C<LC_NUMERIC> in the C
(or equivalent) locale would break a lot of CPAN, which is expecting the radix
(decimal point) character to be a dot.)

=item *

The system function it replaces can have its static return buffer trashed,
not only by a subsequent call to that function, but by a C<freelocale>,
C<setlocale>, or other locale change.  The returned buffer of this function is
not changed until the next call to it, so the buffer is never in a trashed
state.

=item *

Its return buffer is per-thread, so it also is never overwritten by a call to
this function from another thread;  unlike the function it replaces.

=item *

But most importantly, it works on systems that don't have C<nl_langinfo>, such
as Windows, hence makes your code more portable.  Of the fifty-some possible
items specified by the POSIX 2008 standard,
L<http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/langinfo.h.html>,
only one is completely unimplemented, though on non-Windows platforms, another
significant one is also not implemented).  It uses various techniques to
recover the other items, including calling C<L<localeconv(3)>>, and
C<L<strftime(3)>>, both of which are specified in C89, so should be always be
available.  Later C<strftime()> versions have additional capabilities; C<""> is
returned for those not available on your system.

It is important to note that when called with an item that is recovered by
using C<localeconv>, the buffer from any previous explicit call to
C<localeconv> will be overwritten.  This means you must save that buffer's
contents if you need to access them after a call to this function.  (But note
that you might not want to be using C<localeconv()> directly anyway, because of
issues like the ones listed in the second item of this list (above) for
C<RADIXCHAR> and C<THOUSEP>.  You can use the methods given in L<perlcall> to
call L<POSIX/localeconv> and avoid all the issues, but then you have a hash to
unpack).

The details for those items which may deviate from what this emulation returns
and what a native C<nl_langinfo()> would return are specified in
L<I18N::Langinfo>.

=back

When using C<Perl_langinfo> on systems that don't have a native
C<nl_langinfo()>, you must

 #include "perl_langinfo.h"

before the C<perl.h> C<#include>.  You can replace your C<langinfo.h>
C<#include> with this one.  (Doing it this way keeps out the symbols that plain
C<langinfo.h> would try to import into the namespace for code that doesn't need
it.)

The original impetus for C<Perl_langinfo()> was so that code that needs to
find out the current currency symbol, floating point radix character, or digit
grouping separator can use, on all systems, the simpler and more
thread-friendly C<nl_langinfo> API instead of C<L<localeconv(3)>> which is a
pain to make thread-friendly.  For other fields returned by C<localeconv>, it
is better to use the methods given in L<perlcall> to call
L<C<POSIX::localeconv()>|POSIX/localeconv>, which is thread-friendly.

=item C<Perl_setlocale>
X<Perl_setlocale>

This is an (almost) drop-in replacement for the system L<C<setlocale(3)>>,
taking the same parameters, and returning the same information, except that it
returns the correct underlying C<LC_NUMERIC> locale.  Regular C<setlocale> will
instead return C<C> if the underlying locale has a non-dot decimal point
character, or a non-empty thousands separator for displaying floating point
numbers.  This is because perl keeps that locale category such that it has a
dot and empty separator, changing the locale briefly during the operations
where the underlying one is required. C<Perl_setlocale> knows about this, and
compensates; regular C<setlocale> doesn't.

Another reason it isn't completely a drop-in replacement is that it is
declared to return S<C<const char *>>, whereas the system setlocale omits the
C<const> (presumably because its API was specified long ago, and can't be
updated; it is illegal to change the information C<setlocale> returns; doing
so leads to segfaults.)

Finally, C<Perl_setlocale> works under all circumstances, whereas plain
C<setlocale> can be completely ineffective on some platforms under some
configurations.

C<Perl_setlocale> should not be used to change the locale except on systems
where the predefined variable C<${^SAFE_LOCALES}> is 1.  On some such systems,
the system C<setlocale()> is ineffective, returning the wrong information, and
failing to actually change the locale.  C<Perl_setlocale>, however works
properly in all circumstances.

The return points to a per-thread static buffer, which is overwritten the next
time C<Perl_setlocale> is called from the same thread.

This is used by XS code that is C<LC_NUMERIC> locale-aware to force the
locale for category C<LC_NUMERIC> to be what perl thinks is the current
underlying locale.  (The perl interpreter could be wrong about what the
underlying locale actually is if some C or XS code has called the C library
function L<setlocale(3)> behind its back; calling L</sync_locale> before calling
this macro will update perl's records.)

A call to L</DECLARATION_FOR_LC_NUMERIC_MANIPULATION> must have been made to
declare at compile time a private variable used by this macro.  This macro
should be called as a single statement, not an expression, but with an empty

The private variable is used to save the current locale state, so
that the requisite matching call to L</RESTORE_LC_NUMERIC> can restore it.

a mutex to force a critical section.  Therefore the matching RESTORE should be

This is used to help wrap XS or C code that is C<LC_NUMERIC> locale-aware.
This locale category is generally kept set to a locale where the decimal radix
character is a dot, and the separator between groups of digits is empty.  This
is because most XS code that reads floating point numbers is expecting them to
have this syntax.

This macro makes sure the current C<LC_NUMERIC> state is set properly, to be
aware of locale if the call to the XS or C code from the Perl program is
from within the scope of a S<C<use locale>>; or to ignore locale if the call is
instead from outside such scope.

This macro is the start of wrapping the C or XS code; the wrap ending is done
by calling the L</RESTORE_LC_NUMERIC> macro after the operation.  Otherwise
the state can be changed that will adversely affect other XS code.

A call to L</DECLARATION_FOR_LC_NUMERIC_MANIPULATION> must have been made to
declare at compile time a private variable used by this macro.  This macro
should be called as a single statement, not an expression, but with an empty

X<switch_to_global_locale>

On systems without locale support, or on typical single-threaded builds, or on
platforms that do not support per-thread locale operations, this function does
nothing.  On such systems that do have locale support, only a locale global to
the whole program is available.

On multi-threaded builds on systems that do have per-thread locale operations,
this function converts the thread it is running in to use the global locale.
This is for code that has not yet or cannot be updated to handle multi-threaded
locale operation.  As long as only a single thread is so-converted, everything
works fine, as all the other threads continue to ignore the global one, so only
this thread looks at it.

However, on Windows systems this isn't quite true prior to Visual Studio 15,
at which point Microsoft fixed a bug.  A race can occur if you use the
following operations on earlier Windows platforms:

=over

=item L<POSIX::localeconv|POSIX/localeconv>

The first item is not fixable (except by upgrading to a later Visual Studio
release), but it would be possible to work around the latter two items by using
the Windows API functions C<GetNumberFormat> and C<GetCurrencyFormat>; patches
welcome.

Without this function call, threads that use the L<C<setlocale(3)>> system
function will not work properly, as all the locale-sensitive functions will
look at the per-thread locale, and C<setlocale> will have no effect on this
thread.

Perl code should convert to either call
L<C<Perl_setlocale>|perlapi/Perl_setlocale> (which is a drop-in for the system
C<setlocale>) or use the methods given in L<perlcall> to call
L<C<POSIX::setlocale>|POSIX/setlocale>.  Either one will transparently properly
handle all cases of single- vs multi-thread, POSIX 2008-supported or not.

Non-Perl libraries, such as C<gtk>, that call the system C<setlocale> can
continue to work if this function is called before transferring control to the
library.

Upon return from the code that needs to use the global locale,
L<C<sync_locale()>|perlapi/sync_locale> should be called to restore the safe
multi-thread operation.

L<C<Perl_setlocale>|perlapi/Perl_setlocale> can be used at any time to query or

multi-threaded systems that don't have multi-thread safe locale operations.
(See L<perllocale/Multi-threaded operation>).  Using the system
L<C<setlocale(3)>> should be avoided.  Nevertheless, certain non-Perl libraries
called from XS, such as C<Gtk> do so, and this can't be changed.  When the
locale is changed by XS code that didn't use
L<C<Perl_setlocale>|perlapi/Perl_setlocale>, Perl needs to be told that the
locale has changed.  Use this function to do so, before returning to Perl.

The return value is a boolean: TRUE if the global locale at the time of call
was in effect; and FALSE if a per-thread locale was in effect.  This can be
used by the caller that needs to restore things as-they-were to decide whether
or not to call

=head1 Magic


"Magic" is special data attached to SV structures in order to give them
"magical" properties.  When any Perl code tries to read from, or assign to,
an SV marked as magical, it calls the 'get' or 'set' function associated
with that SV's magic.  A get is called prior to reading an SV, in order to
give it a chance to update its internal value (get on $. writes the line
number of the last read filehandle into the SV's IV slot), while
set is called after an SV has been written to, in order to allow it to make
use of its changed value (set on $/ copies the SV's new value to the
PL_rs global variable).

Magic is implemented as a linked list of MAGIC structures attached to the
SV.  Each MAGIC struct holds the type of the magic, a pointer to an array
of functions that implement the get(), set(), length() etc functions,
plus space for some flags and pointers.  For example, a tied variable has
a MAGIC structure that contains a pointer to the object associated with the
tie.

This preprocessor macro is defined to convert a floating point
number to a string without a trailing decimal point.  This
emulates the behavior of C<sprintf("%g")>, but is sometimes much more
efficient.  If C<gconvert()> is not available, but C<gcvt()> drops the
trailing decimal point, then C<gcvt()> is used.  If all else fails,
a macro using C<sprintf("%g")> is used. Arguments for the Gconvert
macro are: value, number of digits, whether trailing zeros should
be retained, and the output buffer.
The usual values are:

 d_Gconvert='gconvert((x),(n),(t),(b))'
 d_Gconvert='gcvt((x),(n),(b))'
 d_Gconvert='sprintf((b),"%.*g",(n),(x))'

The last two assume trailing zeros should not be kept.

converts a string representing a binary number to numeric form.

On entry C<start> and C<*len_p> give the string to scan, C<*flags> gives

scan stops at the end of the string, or at just before the first invalid
character.  Unless C<PERL_SCAN_SILENT_ILLDIGIT> is set in C<*flags>,
encountering an invalid character (except NUL) will also trigger a warning.  On
return C<*len_p> is set to the length of the scanned string, and C<*flags>
gives output flags.

If the value is <= C<UV_MAX> it is returned as a UV, the output flags are clear,
and nothing is written to C<*result>.  If the value is > C<UV_MAX>, C<grok_bin>
returns C<UV_MAX>, sets C<PERL_SCAN_GREATER_THAN_UV_MAX> in the output flags,
and writes an approximation of the correct value into C<*result> (which is an
NV; or the approximation is discarded if C<result> is NULL).

The binary number may optionally be prefixed with C<"0b"> or C<"b"> unless
C<PERL_SCAN_DISALLOW_PREFIX> is set in C<*flags> on entry.

If C<PERL_SCAN_ALLOW_UNDERSCORES> is set in C<*flags> then any or all pairs of

If the value of the number can fit in a UV, it is returned in C<*valuep>.
C<IS_NUMBER_IN_UV> will be set to indicate that C<*valuep> is valid, C<IS_NUMBER_IN_UV>
will never be set unless C<*valuep> is valid, but C<*valuep> may have been assigned
to during processing even though C<IS_NUMBER_IN_UV> is not set on return.
If C<valuep> is C<NULL>, C<IS_NUMBER_IN_UV> will be set for the same cases as when
C<valuep> is non-C<NULL>, but no actual assignment (or SEGV) will occur.

C<IS_NUMBER_NOT_INT> will be set with C<IS_NUMBER_IN_UV> if trailing decimals were
seen (in which case C<*valuep> gives the true value truncated to an integer), and

Return a non-zero integer if the sign bit on an NV is set, and 0 if

fall back on this implementation.  The main use of this function
is catching C<-0.0>.

C<Configure> notes:  This function is called C<'Perl_signbit'> instead of a
plain C<'signbit'> because it is easy to imagine a system having a C<signbit()>
function or macro that doesn't happen to work with our particular choice
of NVs.  We shouldn't just re-C<#define> C<signbit> as C<Perl_signbit> and expect
the standard system headers to be happy.  Also, this is a no-context
function (no C<pTHX_>) because C<Perl_signbit()> is usually re-C<#defined> in

This array, indexed by an integer, converts that value into the character that
represents it.  For example, if the input is 8, the return will be a string
whose first character is '8'.  What is actually returned is a pointer into a
string.  All you are interested in is the first character of that string.  To
get uppercase letters (for the values 10..15), add 16 to the index.  Hence,
C<PL_hexdigit[11]> is C<'b'>, and C<PL_hexdigit[11+16]> is C<'B'>.  Adding 16
to an index whose representation is '0'..'9' yields the same as not adding 16.

Pointer to the per-subroutine peephole optimiser.  This is a function

called once for each subroutine that is compiled, and is passed, as sole
parameter, a pointer to the op that is the entry point to the subroutine.
It modifies the op tree in place.

Performs the fixup of the arguments part of an C<entersub> op tree
based on a subroutine prototype.  This makes various modifications to

and checking the number and syntactic types of arguments, as directed by
the prototype.  This is the standard treatment used on a subroutine call,

Retrieves the function that will be used to fix up a call to C<cv>.
Specifically, the function is applied to an C<entersub> op tree for a
subroutine call, not marked with C<&>, where the callee can be identified
at compile time as C<cv>.

The C-level function pointer is returned in C<*ckfun_p>, an SV argument
for it is returned in C<*ckobj_p>, and control flags are returned in
C<*ckflags_p>.  The function is intended to be called in this manner:

 entersubop = (*ckfun_p)(aTHX_ entersubop, namegv, (*ckobj_p));

In this call, C<entersubop> is a pointer to the C<entersub> op,
which may be replaced by the check function, and C<namegv> supplies
the name that should be used by the check function to refer
to the callee of the C<entersub> op if it needs to emit any diagnostics.
It is permitted to apply the check function in non-standard situations,
such as to a call to a different subroutine or to a method call.

C<namegv> may not actually be a GV.  If the C<CALL_CHECKER_REQUIRE_GV>
bit is clear in C<*ckflags_p>, it is permitted to pass a CV or other SV
instead, anything that can be used as the first argument to L</cv_name>.
If the C<CALL_CHECKER_REQUIRE_GV> bit is set in C<*ckflags_p> then the
check function requires C<namegv> to be a genuine GV.

By default, the check function is
L<Perl_ck_entersub_args_proto_or_list|/ck_entersub_args_proto_or_list>,
the SV parameter is C<cv> itself, and the C<CALL_CHECKER_REQUIRE_GV>
flag is clear.  This implements standard prototype processing.  It can
be changed, for a particular subroutine, by L</cv_set_call_checker_flags>.

If the C<CALL_CHECKER_REQUIRE_GV> bit is set in C<gflags> then it
indicates that the caller only knows about the genuine GV version of
C<namegv>, and accordingly the corresponding bit will always be set in
C<*ckflags_p>, regardless of the check function's recorded requirements.
If the C<CALL_CHECKER_REQUIRE_GV> bit is clear in C<gflags> then it
indicates the caller knows about the possibility of passing something
other than a GV as C<namegv>, and accordingly the corresponding bit may
be either set or clear in C<*ckflags_p>, indicating the check function's
recorded requirements.

C<gflags> is a bitset passed into C<cv_get_call_checker_flags>, in which
only the C<CALL_CHECKER_REQUIRE_GV> bit currently has a defined meaning
(for which see above).  All other bits should be clear.

such as to a call to a different subroutine or to a method call.

C<namegv> may not actually be a GV.  For efficiency, perl may pass a
CV or other SV instead.  Whatever is passed can be used as the first
argument to L</cv_name>.  You can force perl to pass a GV by including
C<CALL_CHECKER_REQUIRE_GV> in the C<ckflags>.

C<ckflags> is a bitset, in which only the C<CALL_CHECKER_REQUIRE_GV>
bit currently has a defined meaning (for which see above).  All other
bits should be clear.

The current setting for a particular CV can be retrieved by

=item C<newCONSTSUB_flags>
X<newCONSTSUB_flags>

Construct a constant subroutine, also performing some surrounding
jobs.  A scalar constant-valued subroutine is eligible for inlining
at compile-time, and in Perl code can be created by S<C<sub FOO () {
123 }>>.  Other kinds of constant subroutine have other treatment.

The subroutine will have an empty prototype and will ignore any arguments
when called.  Its constant behaviour is determined by C<sv>.  If C<sv>
is null, the subroutine will yield an empty list.  If C<sv> points to a
scalar, the subroutine will always yield that scalar.  If C<sv> points
to an array, the subroutine will always yield a list of the elements of
that array in list context, or the number of elements in the array in
scalar context.  This function takes ownership of one counted reference
to the scalar or array, and will arrange for the object to live as long
as the subroutine does.  If C<sv> points to a scalar then the inlining
assumes that the value of the scalar will never change, so the caller
must ensure that the scalar is not subsequently written to.  If C<sv>
points to an array then no such assumption is made, so it is ostensibly
safe to mutate the array or its elements, but whether this is really
supported has not been determined.

The subroutine will have C<CvFILE> set according to C<PL_curcop>.
Other aspects of the subroutine will be left in their default state.
The caller is free to mutate the subroutine beyond its initial state
after this function has returned.

If C<name> is null then the subroutine will be anonymous, with its
C<CvGV> referring to an C<__ANON__> glob.  If C<name> is non-null then the
subroutine will be named accordingly, referenced by the appropriate glob.
C<name> is a string of length C<len> bytes giving a sigilless symbol
name, in UTF-8 if C<flags> has the C<SVf_UTF8> bit set and in Latin-1
otherwise.  The name may be either qualified or unqualified.  If the
name is unqualified then it defaults to being in the stash specified by
C<stash> if that is non-null, or to C<PL_curstash> if C<stash> is null.
The symbol is always added to the stash if necessary, with C<GV_ADDMULTI>
semantics.

C<flags> should not have bits set other than C<SVf_UTF8>.

If there is already a subroutine of the specified name, then the new sub
will replace the existing one in the glob.  A warning may be generated
about the redefinition.

If the subroutine has one of a few special names, such as C<BEGIN> or
C<END>, then it will be claimed by the appropriate queue for automatic
running of phase-related subroutines.  In this case the relevant glob will
be left not containing any subroutine, even if it did contain one before.
Execution of the subroutine will likely be a no-op, unless C<sv> was
a tied array or the caller modified the subroutine in some interesting
way before it was executed.  In the case of C<BEGIN>, the treatment is
buggy: the sub will be executed when only half built, and may be deleted
prematurely, possibly causing a crash.

The function returns a pointer to the constructed subroutine.  If the sub
is anonymous then ownership of one counted reference to the subroutine
is transferred to the caller.  If the sub is named then the caller does
not get ownership of a reference.  In most such cases, where the sub
has a non-phase name, the sub will be alive at the point it is returned
by virtue of being contained in the glob that names it.  A phase-named
subroutine will usually be alive by virtue of the reference owned by
the phase's automatic run queue.  A C<BEGIN> subroutine may have been
destroyed already by the time this function returns, but currently bugs
occur in that case before the caller gets control.  It is the caller's
responsibility to ensure that it knows which of these situations applies.

=item C<op_sibling_splice>
X<op_sibling_splice>

A general function for editing the structure of an existing chain of
op_sibling nodes.  By analogy with the perl-level C<splice()> function, allows
you to delete zero or more sequential nodes, replacing them with zero or
more different nodes.  Performs the necessary op_first/op_last
housekeeping on the parent node and op_sibling manipulation on the
children.  The last deleted node will be marked as the last node by
updating the op_sibling/op_sibparent or op_moresib field as appropriate.

Note that op_next is not manipulated, and nodes are not freed; that is the
responsibility of the caller.  It also won't create a new list op for an
empty list etc; use higher-level functions like op_append_elem() for that.

C<parent> is the parent node of the sibling chain. It may passed as C<NULL> if
the splicing doesn't affect the first or last op in the chain.

C<start> is the node preceding the first node to be spliced.  Node(s)
following it will be deleted, and ops will be inserted after it.  If it is
C<NULL>, the first node onwards is deleted, and nodes are inserted at the
beginning.

C<del_count> is the number of nodes to delete.  If zero, no nodes are deleted.
If -1 or greater than or equal to the number of remaining kids, all
remaining kids are deleted.

C<insert> is the first of a chain of nodes to be inserted in place of the nodes.
If C<NULL>, no nodes are inserted.

The head of the chain of deleted ops is returned, or C<NULL> if no ops were
deleted.

For example:

    action                    before      after         returns
    ------                    -----       -----         -------

    splice(P, A, 2, X-Y-Z)    |           |             B-C

=item C<rv2cv_op_cv>
X<rv2cv_op_cv>

Examines an op, which is expected to identify a subroutine at runtime,
and attempts to determine at compile time which subroutine it identifies.
This is normally used during Perl compilation to determine whether
a prototype can be applied to a function call.  C<cvop> is the op
being considered, normally an C<rv2cv> op.  A pointer to the identified
subroutine is returned, if it could be determined statically, and a null
pointer is returned if it was not possible to determine statically.

Currently, the subroutine can be identified statically if the RV that the
C<rv2cv> is to operate on is provided by a suitable C<gv> or C<const> op.
A C<gv> op is suitable if the GV's CV slot is populated.  A C<const> op is
suitable if the constant value must be an RV pointing to a CV.  Details of
this process may change in future versions of Perl.  If the C<rv2cv> op
has the C<OPpENTERSUB_AMPER> flag set then no attempt is made to identify
the subroutine statically: this flag is used to suppress compile-time
magic on a subroutine call, forcing it to use default runtime behaviour.

If C<flags> has the bit C<RV2CVOPCV_MARK_EARLY> set, then the handling
of a GV reference is modified.  If a GV was examined and its CV slot was
found to be empty, then the C<gv> op has the C<OPpEARLY_CV> flag set.
If the op is not optimised away, and the CV slot is later populated with
a subroutine having a prototype, that flag eventually triggers the warning
"called too early to check prototype".

If C<flags> has the bit C<RV2CVOPCV_RETURN_NAME_GV> set, then instead
of returning a pointer to the subroutine it returns a pointer to the
GV giving the most appropriate name for the subroutine in this context.
Normally this is just the C<CvGV> of the subroutine, but for an anonymous
(C<CvANON>) subroutine that is referenced through a GV it will be the
referencing GV.  The resulting C<GV*> is cast to C<CV*> to be returned.
A null pointer is returned as usual if there is no statically-determinable
subroutine.

XSUBs do not have a C<CvPADLIST>.  C<dXSTARG> fetches values from C<PL_curpad>,
but that is really the callers pad (a slot of which is allocated by
every entersub). Do not get or set C<CvPADLIST> if a CV is an XSUB (as
determined by C<CvISXSUB()>), C<CvPADLIST> slot is reused for a different
internal purpose in XSUBs.

The PADLIST has a C array where pads are stored.

The 0th entry of the PADLIST is a PADNAMELIST
which represents the "names" or rather
the "static type information" for lexicals.  The individual elements of a
PADNAMELIST are PADNAMEs.  Future
refactorings might stop the PADNAMELIST from being stored in the PADLIST's
array, so don't rely on it.  See L</PadlistNAMES>.

The CvDEPTH'th entry of a PADLIST is a PAD (an AV) which is the stack frame
at that depth of recursion into the CV.  The 0th slot of a frame AV is an
AV which is C<@_>.  Other entries are storage for variables and op targets.

Iterating over the PADNAMELIST iterates over all possible pad
items.  Pad slots for targets (C<SVs_PADTMP>)
and GVs end up having &PL_padname_undef "names", while slots for constants 
have C<&PL_padname_const> "names" (see C<L</pad_alloc>>).  That
C<&PL_padname_undef>
and C<&PL_padname_const> are used is an implementation detail subject to
change.  To test for them, use C<!PadnamePV(name)> and
S<C<PadnamePV(name) && !PadnameLEN(name)>>, respectively.

Only C<my>/C<our> variable slots get valid names.
The rest are op targets/GVs/constants which are statically allocated
or resolved at compile time.  These don't have names by which they
can be looked up from Perl code at run time through eval"" the way
C<my>/C<our> variables can be.  Since they can't be looked up by "name"
but only by their index allocated at compile time (which is usually
in C<< PL_op->op_targ >>), wasting a name SV for them doesn't make sense.

The pad names in the PADNAMELIST have their PV holding the name of
the variable.  The C<COP_SEQ_RANGE_LOW> and C<_HIGH> fields form a range
(low+1..high inclusive) of cop_seq numbers for which the name is
valid.  During compilation, these fields may hold the special value
PERL_PADSEQ_INTRO to indicate various stages:

 COP_SEQ_RANGE_LOW        _HIGH
 -----------------        -----
 PERL_PADSEQ_INTRO            0   variable not yet introduced:
                                  { my ($x
 valid-seq#   PERL_PADSEQ_INTRO   variable in scope:
                                  { my ($x);
 valid-seq#          valid-seq#   compilation of scope complete:
                                  { my ($x); .... }

When a lexical var hasn't yet been introduced, it already exists from the
perspective of duplicate declarations, but not for variable lookups, e.g.

    my ($x, $x); # '"my" variable $x masks earlier declaration'
    my $x = $x;  # equal to my $x = $::x;

For typed lexicals C<PadnameTYPE> points at the type stash.  For C<our>
lexicals, C<PadnameOURSTASH> points at the stash of the associated global (so
that duplicate C<our> declarations in the same package can be detected).
C<PadnameGEN> is sometimes used to store the generation number during
compilation.

If C<PadnameOUTER> is set on the pad name, then that slot in the frame AV
is a REFCNT'ed reference to a lexical from "outside".  Such entries
are sometimes referred to as 'fake'.  In this case, the name does not
use 'low' and 'high' to store a cop_seq range, since it is in scope
throughout.  Instead 'high' stores some flags containing info about
the real lexical (is it declared in an anon, and is it capable of being
instantiated multiple times?), and for fake ANONs, 'low' contains the index
within the parent's pad where the lexical's value is stored, to make
cloning quicker.

If the 'name' is C<&> the corresponding entry in the PAD
is a CV representing a possible closure.

Note that formats are treated as anon subs, and are cloned each time
write is called (if necessary).

The flag C<SVs_PADSTALE> is cleared on lexicals each time the C<my()> is executed,
and set on scope exit.  This allows the
C<"Variable $x is not available"> warning
to be generated in evals, such as 

    { my $x = 1; sub f { eval '$x'} } f();

For state vars, C<SVs_PADSTALE> is overloaded to mean 'not yet initialised',
but this internal state is stored in a separate pad entry.

=item C<SIG_NAME>
X<SIG_NAME>

This symbol contains a list of signal names in order of
signal number. This is intended
to be used as a static array initialization, like this:

 char *sig_name[] = { SIG_NAME };

The signals in the list are separated with commas, and each signal
is surrounded by double quotes. There is no leading C<SIG> in the signal
name, i.e. C<SIGQUIT> is known as "C<QUIT>".
Gaps in the signal numbers (up to C<NSIG>) are filled in with C<NUMnn>,
etc., where nn is the actual signal number (e.g. C<NUM37>).
The signal number for C<sig_name[i]> is stored in C<sig_num[i]>.
The last element is 0 to terminate the list with a C<NULL>.  This
corresponds to the 0 at the end of the C<sig_name_init> list.
Note that this variable is initialized from the C<sig_name_init>,
not from C<sig_name> (which is unused).

X<SIG_NUM>

This symbol contains a list of signal numbers, in the same order as the

The signals in the list are separated with commas, and the indices
within that list and the C<SIG_NAME> list match, so it's easy to compute
the signal name from a number or vice versa at the price of a small
dynamic linear lookup.
Duplicates are allowed, but are moved to the end of the list.
The signal number corresponding to C<sig_name[i]> is C<sig_number[i]>.
if (i < C<NSIG>) then C<sig_number[i]> == i.
The last element is 0, corresponding to the 0 at the end of
the C<sig_name_init> list.
Note that this variable is initialized from the C<sig_num_init>,
not from C<sig_num> (which is unused).

These all convert a signal name into its corresponding signal number;
returning -1 if no corresponding number was found.

They differ only in the source of the signal name:

C<whichsig_pv> takes the name from the C<NUL>-terminated string starting at
C<sig>.

C<whichsig> is merely a different spelling, a synonym, of C<whichsig_pv>.

C<whichsig_pvn> takes the name from the string starting at C<sig>, with length
C<len> bytes.

C<whichsig_sv> takes the name from the PV stored in the SV C<sigsv>.

=item C<delimcpy>
X<delimcpy>

Copy a source buffer to a destination buffer, stopping at (but not including)
the first occurrence in the source of an unescaped (defined below) delimiter
byte, C<delim>.  The source is the bytes between S<C<from> and C<from_end> -
1>.  Similarly, the dest is C<to> up to C<to_end>.

The number of bytes copied is written to C<*retlen>.

Returns the position of the first uncopied C<delim> in the C<from> buffer, but
if there is no such occurrence before C<from_end>, then C<from_end> is returned,
and the entire buffer S<C<from> .. C<from_end> - 1> is copied.

If there is room in the destination available after the copy, an extra
terminating safety C<NUL> byte is appended (not included in the returned
length).

The error case is if the destination buffer is not large enough to accommodate
everything that should be copied.  In this situation, a value larger than
S<C<to_end> - C<to>> is written to C<*retlen>, and as much of the source as
fits will be written to the destination.  Not having room for the safety C<NUL>
is not considered an error.

In the following examples, let C<x> be the delimiter, and C<0> represent a C<NUL>
byte (B<NOT> the digit C<0>).  Then we would have

  Source     Destination
 abcxdef        abc0

provided the destination buffer is at least 4 bytes long.

An escaped delimiter is one which is immediately preceded by a single
backslash.  Escaped delimiters are copied, and the copy continues past the
delimiter; the backslash is not copied:

  Source       Destination
 abc\xdef       abcxdef0

(provided the destination buffer is at least 8 bytes long).

It's actually somewhat more complicated than that. A sequence of any odd number
of backslashes escapes the following delimiter, and the copy continues with
exactly one of the backslashes stripped.

=item C<my_strlcat>
X<my_strlcat>

The C library C<strlcat> if available, or a Perl implementation of it.
This operates on C C<NUL>-terminated strings.

C<my_strlcat()> appends string C<src> to the end of C<dst>.  It will append at
most S<C<size - strlen(dst) - 1>> characters.  It will then C<NUL>-terminate,
unless C<size> is 0 or the original C<dst> string was longer than C<size> (in
practice this should not happen as it means that either C<size> is incorrect or
that C<dst> is not a proper C<NUL>-terminated string).

Note that C<size> is the full size of the destination buffer and
the result is guaranteed to be C<NUL>-terminated if there is room.  Note that
room for the C<NUL> should be included in C<size>.

The return value is the total length that C<dst> would have if C<size> is
sufficiently large.  Thus it is the initial length of C<dst> plus the length of
C<src>.  If C<size> is smaller than the return, the excess was not appended.

=item C<ninstr>
X<ninstr>

Find the first (leftmost) occurrence of a sequence of bytes within another
sequence.  This is the Perl version of C<strstr()>, extended to handle
arbitrary sequences, potentially containing embedded C<NUL> characters (C<NUL>
is what the initial C<n> in the function name stands for; some systems have an
equivalent, C<memmem()>, but with a somewhat different API).

Another way of thinking about this function is finding a needle in a haystack.
C<big> points to the first byte in the haystack.  C<big_end> points to one byte
beyond the final byte in the haystack.  C<little> points to the first byte in
the needle.  C<little_end> points to one byte beyond the final byte in the
needle.  All the parameters must be non-C<NULL>.

The function returns C<NULL> if there is no occurrence of C<little> within
C<big>.  If C<little> is the empty string, C<big> is returned.

Because this function operates at the byte level, and because of the inherent
characteristics of UTF-8 (or UTF-EBCDIC), it will work properly if both the
needle and the haystack are strings with the same UTF-8ness, but not if the
UTF-8ness differs.

=item C<savepv>
X<savepv>

Perl's version of C<strdup()>.  Returns a pointer to a newly allocated
string which is a duplicate of C<pv>.  The size of the string is
determined by C<strlen()>, which means it may not contain embedded C<NUL>
characters and must have a trailing C<NUL>.  To prevent memory leaks, the
memory allocated for the new string needs to be freed when no longer needed.
This can be done with the C<L</Safefree>> function, or
L<C<SAVEFREEPV>|perlguts/SAVEFREEPV(p)>.

On some platforms, Windows for example, all allocated memory owned by a thread
is deallocated when that thread ends.  So if you need that not to happen, you

=item C<svtype>
X<svtype>

An enum of flags for Perl types.  These are found in the file F<sv.h>
in the C<svtype> enum.  Test these flags with the C<SvTYPE> macro.

The types are:

    SVt_NULL
    SVt_IV
    SVt_NV
    SVt_RV
    SVt_PV
    SVt_PVIV
    SVt_PVNV
    SVt_PVMG
    SVt_INVLIST
    SVt_REGEXP
    SVt_PVGV
    SVt_PVLV
    SVt_PVAV
    SVt_PVHV
    SVt_PVCV
    SVt_PVFM
    SVt_PVIO

These are most easily explained from the bottom up.

C<SVt_PVIO> is for I/O objects, C<SVt_PVFM> for formats, C<SVt_PVCV> for
subroutines, C<SVt_PVHV> for hashes and C<SVt_PVAV> for arrays.

All the others are scalar types, that is, things that can be bound to a
C<$> variable.  For these, the internal types are mostly orthogonal to
types in the Perl language.

Hence, checking C<< SvTYPE(sv) < SVt_PVAV >> is the best way to see whether
something is a scalar.

C<SVt_PVGV> represents a typeglob.  If C<!SvFAKE(sv)>, then it is a real,
incoercible typeglob.  If C<SvFAKE(sv)>, then it is a scalar to which a
typeglob has been assigned.  Assigning to it again will stop it from being
a typeglob.  C<SVt_PVLV> represents a scalar that delegates to another scalar
behind the scenes.  It is used, e.g., for the return value of C<substr> and
for tied hash and array elements.  It can hold any scalar value, including
a typeglob.  C<SVt_REGEXP> is for regular
expressions.  C<SVt_INVLIST> is for Perl
core internal use only.

C<SVt_PVMG> represents a "normal" scalar (not a typeglob, regular expression,
or delegate).  Since most scalars do not need all the internal fields of a
PVMG, we save memory by allocating smaller structs when possible.  All the
other types are just simpler forms of C<SVt_PVMG>, with fewer internal fields.
C<SVt_NULL> can only hold undef.  C<SVt_IV> can hold undef, an integer, or a
reference.  (C<SVt_RV> is an alias for C<SVt_IV>, which exists for backward

=head1 SV Handling


An SV (or AV, HV, etc.) is allocated in two parts: the head (struct
sv, av, hv...) contains type and reference count information, and for
many types, a pointer to the body (struct xrv, xpv, xpviv...), which
contains fields specific to each type.  Some types store all they need
in the head, so don't have a body.

In all but the most memory-paranoid configurations (ex: PURIFY), heads
and bodies are allocated out of arenas, which by default are
approximately 4K chunks of memory parcelled up into N heads or bodies.
Sv-bodies are allocated by their sv-type, guaranteeing size
consistency needed to allocate safely from arrays.

For SV-heads, the first slot in each arena is reserved, and holds a
link to the next arena, some flags, and a note of the number of slots.
Snaked through each arena chain is a linked list of free items; when
this becomes empty, an extra arena is allocated and divided up into N
items which are threaded into the free list.

SV-bodies are similar, but they use arena-sets by default, which
separate the link and info from the arena itself, and reclaim the 1st
slot in the arena.  SV-bodies are further described later.

The following global variables are associated with arenas:

 PL_sv_arenaroot     pointer to list of SV arenas
 PL_sv_root          pointer to list of free SV structures

 PL_body_arenas      head of linked-list of body arenas
 PL_body_roots[]     array of pointers to list of free bodies of svtype
                     arrays are indexed by the svtype needed

A few special SV heads are not allocated from an arena, but are
instead directly created in the interpreter structure, eg PL_sv_undef.
The size of arenas can be changed from the default by setting
PERL_ARENA_SIZE appropriately at compile time.

The SV arena serves the secondary purpose of allowing still-live SVs
to be located and destroyed during final cleanup.

At the lowest level, the macros new_SV() and del_SV() grab and free
an SV head.  (If debugging with -DD, del_SV() calls the function S_del_sv()
to return the SV to the free list with error checking.) new_SV() calls
more_sv() / sv_add_arena() to add an extra arena if the free list is empty.
SVs in the free list have their SvTYPE field set to all ones.

At the time of very final cleanup, sv_free_arenas() is called from
perl_destruct() to physically free all the arenas allocated since the
start of the interpreter.

The internal function visit() scans the SV arenas list, and calls a specified
function for each SV it finds which is still live, I<i.e.> which has an SvTYPE
other than all 1's, and a non-zero SvREFCNT. visit() is used by the
following functions (specified as [function that calls visit()] / [function
called by visit() for each SV]):

    sv_report_used() / do_report_used()
			dump all remaining SVs (debugging aid)

    sv_clean_objs() / do_clean_objs(),do_clean_named_objs(),
		      do_clean_named_io_objs(),do_curse()
			Attempt to free all objects pointed to by RVs,
			try to do the same for all objects indir-
			ectly referenced by typeglobs too, and
			then do a final sweep, cursing any
			objects that remain.  Called once from
			perl_destruct(), prior to calling sv_clean_all()
			below.

    sv_clean_all() / do_clean_all()
			SvREFCNT_dec(sv) each remaining SV, possibly
			triggering an sv_free(). It also sets the
			SVf_BREAK flag on the SV to indicate that the
			refcnt has been artificially lowered, and thus
			stopping sv_free() from giving spurious warnings
			about SVs which unexpectedly have a refcnt
			of zero.  called repeatedly from perl_destruct()
			until there are no SVs left.

=item C<newSVpv>
X<newSVpv>

Creates a new SV and copies a string (which may contain C<NUL> (C<\0>)
characters) into it.  The reference count for the
SV is set to 1.  If C<len> is zero, Perl will compute the length using
C<strlen()>, (which means if you use this option, that C<s> can't have embedded
C<NUL> characters and has to have a terminating C<NUL> byte).

This function can cause reliability issues if you are likely to pass in
empty strings that are not null terminated, because it will run
strlen on the string and potentially run past valid memory.

Using L</newSVpvn> is a safer alternative for non C<NUL> terminated strings.
For string literals use L</newSVpvs> instead.  This function will work fine for
C<NUL> terminated strings, but if you want to avoid the if statement on whether
to call C<strlen> use C<newSVpvn> instead (calling C<strlen> yourself).

Note that if C<len> is zero, Perl will create a zero length (Perl) string.  You
are responsible for ensuring that the source buffer is at least
C<len> bytes long.  If the C<buffer> argument is NULL the new SV will be
undefined.

string.  You are responsible for ensuring that the source string is at least

Currently the only flag bits accepted are C<SVf_UTF8> and C<SVs_TEMP>.
If C<SVs_TEMP> is set, then C<sv_2mortal()> is called on the result before

and C<FAKE> in 5.16 and earlier).  If the C<hash> parameter
is non-zero, that value is used; otherwise the hash is computed.
The string's hash can later be retrieved from the SV
with the C<L</SvSHARED_HASH>> macro.  The idea here is
that as the string table is used for shared hash keys these strings will have
C<SvPVX_const == HeKEY> and hash lookup will avoid string compare.

These concatenate the C<NUL>-terminated string C<sstr> onto the end of the
string which is in the SV.
If the SV has the UTF-8 status set, then the bytes appended should be
valid UTF-8.

They differ only in how they handle magic:

C<sv_catpv_mg> performs both 'get' and 'set' magic.

C<sv_catpv> performs only 'get' magic.

C<sv_catpv_nomg> skips all magic.

C<sv_catpv_flags> has an extra C<flags> parameter which allows you to specify
any combination of magic handling (using C<SV_GMAGIC> and/or C<SV_SMAGIC>), and
to also override the UTF-8 handling.  By supplying the C<SV_CATUTF8> flag, the
appended string is forced to be interpreted as UTF-8; by supplying instead the
C<SV_CATBYTES> flag, it will be interpreted as just bytes.  Either the SV or
the string appended will be upgraded to UTF-8 if necessary.

X<sv_catpvf>X<sv_catpvf_nocontext>X<sv_catpvf_mg>X<sv_catpvf_mg_nocontext>

These process their arguments like C<sprintf>, and append the formatted
output to an SV.  As with C<sv_vcatpvfn>, argument reordering is not supporte
when called with a non-null C-style variable argument list.

If the appended data contains "wide" characters
(including, but not limited to, SVs with a UTF-8 PV formatted with C<%s>,
and characters >255 formatted with C<%c>), the original SV might get
upgraded to UTF-8.

If the original SV was UTF-8, the pattern should be
valid UTF-8; if the original SV was bytes, the pattern should be too.

All perform 'get' magic, but only C<sv_catpvf_mg> and C<sv_catpvf_mg_nocontext>
perform 'set' magic.

C<sv_catpvf_nocontext> and C<sv_catpvf_mg_nocontext> do not take a thread
context (C<aTHX>) parameter, so are used in situations where the caller
doesn't already have the thread context.

NOTE: C<sv_catpvf> must be explicitly called as

These concatenate the C<len> bytes of the string beginning at C<ptr> onto the
end of the string which is in C<dsv>.  The caller must make sure C<ptr>
contains at least C<len> bytes.

For all but C<sv_catpvn_flags>, the string appended is assumed to be valid
UTF-8 if the SV has the UTF-8 status set, and a string of bytes otherwise.

They differ in that:

C<sv_catpvn_mg> performs both 'get' and 'set' magic on C<dsv>.

C<sv_catpvn> performs only 'get' magic.

C<sv_catpvn_nomg> skips all magic.

C<sv_catpvn_flags> has an extra C<flags> parameter which allows you to specify
any combination of magic handling (using C<SV_GMAGIC> and/or C<SV_SMAGIC>) and

Efficient removal of characters from the beginning of the string buffer.

These copy a stringified representation of the source SV into the

Similar in nature to C<sv_2pv[_flags]> but they operate directly on an SV

NOTE: C<sv_get_backrefs> is B<experimental> and may change or be
removed without notice.

If C<sv> is the target of a weak reference then it returns the back
references structure associated with the sv; otherwise return C<NULL>.

When returning a non-null result the type of the return is relevant. If it
is an AV then the elements of the AV are the weak reference RVs which
point at this item. If it is any other type then the item itself is the
weak reference.

X<SvGROW>

Expands the character buffer in the SV so that it has room for the
indicated number of bytes (remember to reserve space for an extra trailing
C<NUL> character).  Calls C<sv_grow> to perform the expansion if necessary.
Returns a pointer to the character
buffer.  SV must be of type >= C<SVt_PV>.  One
alternative is to call C<sv_grow> if you are not sure of the type of SV.

You might mistakenly think that C<len> is the number of bytes to add to the

All these return a pointer to the string in C<sv>, or a stringified form of
C<sv> if it does not contain a string.  The SV may cache the stringified
version becoming C<SvPOK>.

This is a very basic and common operation, so there are lots of slightly
different versions of it.

Note that there is no guarantee that the return value of C<SvPV(sv)>, for
example, is equal to C<SvPVX(sv)>, or that C<SvPVX(sv)> contains valid data, or
that successive calls to C<SvPV(sv)> (or another of these forms) will return
the same pointer value each time.  This is due to the way that things like
overloading and Copy-On-Write are handled.  In these cases, the return value
may point to a temporary buffer or similar.  If you absolutely need the
C<SvPVX> field to be valid (for example, if you intend to write to it), then
see C<L</SvPV_force>>.

The differences between the forms are:

The forms with neither C<byte> nor C<utf8> in their names (e.g., C<SvPV> or
C<SvPV_nolen>) can expose the SV's internal string buffer. If
that buffer consists entirely of bytes 0-255 and includes any bytes above
127, then you B<MUST> consult C<SvUTF8> to determine the actual code points
the string is meant to contain. Generally speaking, it is probably safer to
prefer C<SvPVbyte>, C<SvPVutf8>, and the like. See
L<perlguts/How do I pass a Perl string to a C library?> for more details.

The forms with C<flags> in their names allow you to use the C<flags> parameter
to specify to process 'get' magic (by setting the C<SV_GMAGIC> flag) or to skip
'get' magic (by clearing it).  The other forms process 'get' magic, except for
the ones with C<nomg> in their names, which skip 'get' magic.

The forms that take a C<len> parameter will set that variable to the byte
length of the resultant string (these are macros, so don't use C<&len>).

The forms with C<nolen> in their names indicate they don't have a C<len>
parameter.  They should be used only when it is known that the PV is a C
string, terminated by a NUL byte, and without intermediate NUL characters; or
when you don't care about its length.

The forms with C<const> in their names return S<C<const char *>> so that the
compiler will hopefully complain if you were to try to modify the contents of
the string (unless you cast away const yourself).

The other forms return a mutable pointer so that the string is modifiable by
the caller; this is emphasized for the ones with C<mutable> in their names.

The forms whose name ends in C<x> are the same as the corresponding form
without the C<x>, but the C<x> form is guaranteed to evaluate C<sv> exactly
once, with a slight loss of efficiency.  Use this if C<sv> is an expression
with side effects.

C<SvPVutf8> is like C<SvPV>, but converts C<sv> to UTF-8 first if not already
UTF-8.  Similiarly, the other forms with C<utf8> in their names correspond to
their respective forms without.

C<SvPVutf8_or_null> and C<SvPVutf8_or_null_nomg> don't have corresponding
non-C<utf8> forms.  Instead they are like C<SvPVutf8_nomg>, but when C<sv> is
undef, they return C<NULL>.

C<SvPVbyte> is like C<SvPV>, but converts C<sv> to byte representation first if
currently encoded as UTF-8.  If C<sv> cannot be downgraded from UTF-8, it
croaks.  Similiarly, the other forms with C<byte> in their names correspond to
their respective forms without.

C<SvPVbyte_or_null> doesn't have a corresponding non-C<byte> form.  Instead it
is like C<SvPVbyte>, but when C<sv> is undef, it returns C<NULL>.

These are like C<L</SvPV>>, returning the string in the SV, but will force the
SV into containing a string (C<L</SvPOK>>), and only a string
(C<L</SvPOK_only>>), by hook or by crook.  You need to use one of these
C<force> routines if you are going to update the C<L</SvPVX>> directly.

Note that coercing an arbitrary scalar into a plain PV will potentially
strip useful data from it.  For example if the SV was C<SvROK>, then the
referent will have its reference count decremented, and the SV itself may
be converted to an C<SvPOK> scalar with a string buffer containing a value
such as C<"ARRAY(0x1234)">.

The differences between the forms are:

The forms with C<flags> in their names allow you to use the C<flags> parameter

parameter.  They should be used only when it is known that the PV is a C
string, terminated by a NUL byte, and without intermediate NUL characters; or
when you don't care about its length.

The forms with C<mutable> in their names are effectively the same as those without,

in all the forms.

Make the first argument a copy of the second, then delete the original.
The target SV physically takes over ownership of the body of the source SV
and inherits its flags; however, the target keeps any magic it owns,
and any magic in the source is discarded.
Note that this is a rather specialist SV copying operation; most of the

These copy the contents of the source SV C<ssv> into the destination SV C<dsv>.
C<ssv> may be destroyed if it is mortal, so don't use these functions if
the source SV needs to be reused.
Loosely speaking, they perform a copy-by-value, obliterating any previous
content of the destination.

They differ only in that:

C<sv_setsv> calls 'get' magic on C<ssv>, but skips 'set' magic on C<dsv>.

C<sv_setsv_mg> calls both 'get' magic on C<ssv> and 'set' magic on C<dsv>.

C<sv_setsv_nomg> skips all magic.

C<sv_setsv_flags> has a C<flags> parameter which you can use to specify any
combination of magic handling, and also you can specify C<SV_NOSTEAL> so that
the buffers of temps will not be stolen.

You probably want to instead use one of the assortment of wrappers, such as

calling C<sv_usepvn_flags> with C<flags> of 0, hence does not handle 'set'
magic.  See C<L</sv_usepvn_flags>>.

=item C<sv_usepvn_flags>
X<sv_usepvn_flags>

Tells an SV to use C<ptr> to find its string value.  Normally the
string is stored inside the SV, but sv_usepvn allows the SV to use an
outside string.  C<ptr> should point to memory that was allocated
by L<C<Newx>|perlclib/Memory Management and String Handling>.  It must be
the start of a C<Newx>-ed block of memory, and not a pointer to the
middle of it (beware of L<C<OOK>|perlguts/Offsets> and copy-on-write),
and not be from a non-C<Newx> memory allocator like C<malloc>.  The
string length, C<len>, must be supplied.  By default this function
will C<Renew> (i.e. realloc, move) the memory pointed to by C<ptr>,
so that pointer should not be freed or used by the programmer after
giving it to C<sv_usepvn>, and neither should any pointers from "behind"
that pointer (e.g. ptr + 1) be used.

If S<C<flags & SV_SMAGIC>> is true, will call C<SvSETMAGIC>.  If
S<C<flags & SV_HAS_TRAILING_NUL>> is true, then C<ptr[len]> must be C<NUL>,
and the realloc
will be skipped (i.e. the buffer is actually at least 1 byte longer than
C<len>, and already meets the requirements for storing in C<SvPVX>).

=item C<SvUTF8>
X<SvUTF8>

Returns a U32 value indicating the UTF-8 status of an SV.  If things are set-up
properly, this indicates whether or not the SV contains UTF-8 encoded data.
You should use this I<after> a call to C<L</SvPV>> or one of its variants, in
case any call to string overloading updates the internal flag.

If you want to take into account the L<bytes> pragma, use C<L</DO_UTF8>>
instead.

If the PV of the SV is an octet sequence in Perl's extended UTF-8
and contains a multiple-byte character, the C<SvUTF8> flag is turned on
so that it looks like a character.  If the PV contains only single-byte
characters, the C<SvUTF8> flag stays off.
Scans PV for validity and returns FALSE if the PV is invalid UTF-8.

These attempt to convert the PV of an SV from characters to bytes.  If the PV
contains a character that cannot fit in a byte, this conversion will fail; in
this case, C<FALSE> is returned if C<fail_ok> is true; otherwise they croak.

They are not a general purpose Unicode to byte encoding interface:
use the C<Encode> extension for that.

They differ only in that:

C<sv_utf8_downgrade> processes 'get' magic on C<sv>.

C<sv_utf8_downgrade_nomg> does not.

C<sv_utf8_downgrade_flags> has an additional C<flags> parameter in which you can specify
C<SV_GMAGIC> to process 'get' magic, or leave it cleared to not proccess 'get' magic.

These convert the PV of an SV to its UTF-8-encoded form.
The SV is forced to string form if it is not already.
They always set the C<SvUTF8> flag to avoid future validity checks even if the
whole string is the same in UTF-8 as not.
They return the number of bytes in the converted string

The forms differ in just two ways.  The main difference is whether or not they
perform 'get magic' on C<sv>.  C<sv_utf8_upgrade_nomg> skips 'get magic';
C<sv_utf8_upgrade> performs it; and C<sv_utf8_upgrade_flags> and
C<sv_utf8_upgrade_flags_grow> either perform it (if the C<SV_GMAGIC> bit is set
in C<flags>) or don't (if that bit is cleared).

The other difference is that C<sv_utf8_upgrade_flags_grow> has an additional
parameter, C<extra>, which allows the caller to specify an amount of space to
be reserved as spare beyond what is needed for the actual conversion.  This is
used when the caller knows it will soon be needing yet more space, and it is
more efficient to request space from the system in a single call.
This form is otherwise identical to C<sv_utf8_upgrade_flags>.

These are not a general purpose byte encoding to Unicode interface: use the
Encode extension for that.

The C<SV_FORCE_UTF8_UPGRADE> flag is now ignored.

missing (C<NULL>). Argument reordering (using format specifiers like C<%2$d> or
C<%*2$d>) is supported only when using an array of SVs; using a C-style
C<va_list> argument list with a format string that uses argument reordering
will yield an exception.

When running with taint checks enabled, they indicate via C<maybe_tainted> if
results are untrustworthy (often due to the use of locales).

They assume that C<pat> has the same utf8-ness as C<sv>.  It's the caller's
responsibility to ensure that this is so.

They differ in that C<sv_vcatpvfn_flags> has a C<flags> parameter in which you
can set or clear the C<SV_GMAGIC> and/or S<SV_SMAGIC> flags, to specify which
magic to handle or not handle; whereas plain C<sv_vcatpvfn> always specifies

CALLER).  This allows this function to increase the buffer size as needed,
so that the caller doesn't have to worry about that.

Note that yday and wday effectively are ignored by this function, as
mini_mktime() overwrites them

Also note that this is always executed in the underlying locale of the program,
giving localized results.

=item C<bytes_from_utf8>
X<bytes_from_utf8>

NOTE: C<bytes_from_utf8> is B<experimental> and may change or be
removed without notice.

Converts a potentially UTF-8 encoded string C<s> of length C<*lenp> into native
byte encoding.  On input, the boolean C<*is_utf8p> gives whether or not C<s> is
actually encoded in UTF-8.

Unlike L</utf8_to_bytes> but like L</bytes_to_utf8>, this is non-destructive of
the input string.

Do nothing if C<*is_utf8p> is 0, or if there are code points in the string
not expressible in native byte encoding.  In these cases, C<*is_utf8p> and
C<*lenp> are unchanged, and the return value is the original C<s>.

Otherwise, C<*is_utf8p> is set to 0, and the return value is a pointer to a
newly created string containing a downgraded copy of C<s>, and whose length is
returned in C<*lenp>, updated.  The new string is C<NUL>-terminated.  The
caller is responsible for arranging for the memory used by this string to get
freed.

Upon successful return, the number of variants in the string can be computed by
having saved the value of C<*lenp> before the call, and subtracting the
after-call value of C<*lenp> from it.

Converts a string C<s> of length C<*lenp> bytes from the native encoding into
UTF-8.
Returns a pointer to the newly-created string, and sets C<*lenp> to
reflect the new length in bytes.  The caller is responsible for arranging for
the memory used by this string to get freed.

Upon successful return, the number of variants in the string can be computed by
having saved the value of C<*lenp> before the call, and subtracting it from the
after-call value of C<*lenp>.

A C<NUL> character will be written after the end of the string.

=item C<foldEQ_utf8>
X<foldEQ_utf8>

Returns true if the leading portions of the strings C<s1> and C<s2> (either or
both of which may be in UTF-8) are the same case-insensitively; false
otherwise.  How far into the strings to compare is determined by other input
parameters.

If C<u1> is true, the string C<s1> is assumed to be in UTF-8-encoded Unicode;
otherwise it is assumed to be in native 8-bit encoding.  Correspondingly for
C<u2> with respect to C<s2>.

If the byte length C<l1> is non-zero, it says how far into C<s1> to check for
fold equality.  In other words, C<s1>+C<l1> will be used as a goal to reach.
The scan will not be considered to be a match unless the goal is reached, and
scanning won't continue past that goal.  Correspondingly for C<l2> with respect
to C<s2>.

If C<pe1> is non-C<NULL> and the pointer it points to is not C<NULL>, that
pointer is considered an end pointer to the position 1 byte past the maximum
point in C<s1> beyond which scanning will not continue under any circumstances.
(This routine assumes that UTF-8 encoded input strings are not malformed;
malformed input can cause it to read past C<pe1>).  This means that if both
C<l1> and C<pe1> are specified, and C<pe1> is less than C<s1>+C<l1>, the match
will never be successful because it can never
get as far as its goal (and in fact is asserted against).  Correspondingly for
C<pe2> with respect to C<s2>.

At least one of C<s1> and C<s2> must have a goal (at least one of C<l1> and
C<l2> must be non-zero), and if both do, both have to be
reached for a successful match.   Also, if the fold of a character is multiple
characters, all of them must be matched (see tr21 reference below for
'folding').

Upon a successful match, if C<pe1> is non-C<NULL>,
it will be set to point to the beginning of the I<next> character of C<s1>
beyond what was matched.  Correspondingly for C<pe2> and C<s2>.

For case-insensitiveness, the "casefolding" of Unicode is used
instead of upper/lowercasing both the characters, see
L<https://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr21/> (Case Mappings).

X<is_utf8_char>

C<B<DEPRECATED!>>  It is planned to remove C<is_utf8_char> from a
future release of Perl.  Do not use it for new code; remove it from
existing code.

Tests if some arbitrary number of bytes begins in a valid UTF-8
character.  Note that an INVARIANT (i.e. ASCII on non-EBCDIC machines)
character is a valid UTF-8 character.  The actual number of bytes in the UTF-8
character will be returned if it is valid, otherwise 0.

This function is deprecated due to the possibility that malformed input could
cause reading beyond the end of the input buffer.  Use L</isUTF8_CHAR>
instead.

X<is_utf8_valid_partial_char>

Returns 0 if the sequence of bytes starting at C<s> and looking no further than
S<C<e - 1>> is the UTF-8 encoding, as extended by Perl, for one or more code
points.  Otherwise, it returns 1 if there exists at least one non-empty
sequence of bytes that when appended to sequence C<s>, starting at position
C<e> causes the entire sequence to be the well-formed UTF-8 of some code point;
otherwise returns 0.

In other words this returns TRUE if C<s> points to a partial UTF-8-encoded code
point.

This is useful when a fixed-length buffer is being tested for being well-formed
UTF-8, but the final few bytes in it don't comprise a full character; that is,
it is split somewhere in the middle of the final code point's UTF-8
representation.  (Presumably when the buffer is refreshed with the next chunk
of data, the new first bytes will complete the partial code point.)   This
function is used to verify that the final bytes in the current buffer are in
fact the legal beginning of some code point, so that if they aren't, the
failure can be signalled without having to wait for the next read.

there is any sequence of bytes that can complete the input partial character in
such a way that a non-prohibited character is formed, the function returns
TRUE; otherwise FALSE.  Non character code points cannot be determined based on
partial character input.  But many  of the other possible excluded types can be

Evaluates to non-zero if the first few bytes of the string starting at C<s> and

that represents some code point; otherwise it evaluates to 0.  If non-zero, the
value gives how many bytes starting at C<s> comprise the code point's
representation.  Any bytes remaining before C<e>, but beyond the ones needed to
form the first code point in C<s>, are not examined.

The code point can be any that will fit in an IV on this machine, using Perl's
extension to official UTF-8 to represent those higher than the Unicode maximum
of 0x10FFFF.  That means that this macro is used to efficiently decide if the
next few bytes in C<s> is legal UTF-8 for a single character.

Use C<L</isSTRICT_UTF8_CHAR>> to restrict the acceptable code points to those
defined by Unicode to be fully interchangeable across applications;

THIS FUNCTION SHOULD BE USED IN ONLY VERY SPECIALIZED CIRCUMSTANCES.
Most code should use L</utf8_to_uvchr_buf>() rather than call this
directly.

Bottom level UTF-8 decode routine.
Returns the native code point value of the first character in the string C<s>,
which is assumed to be in UTF-8 (or UTF-EBCDIC) encoding, and no longer than
C<curlen> bytes; C<*retlen> (if C<retlen> isn't NULL) will be set to
the length, in bytes, of that character.

The value of C<flags> determines the behavior when C<s> does not point to a
well-formed UTF-8 character.  If C<flags> is 0, encountering a malformation
causes zero to be returned and C<*retlen> is set so that (S<C<s> + C<*retlen>>)
is the next possible position in C<s> that could begin a non-malformed
character.  Also, if UTF-8 warnings haven't been lexically disabled, a warning
is raised.  Some UTF-8 input sequences may contain multiple malformations.
This function tries to find every possible one in each call, so multiple
warnings can be raised for the same sequence.

Various ALLOW flags can be set in C<flags> to allow (and not warn on)
individual types of malformations, such as the sequence being overlong (that
is, when there is a shorter sequence that can express the same code point;
overlong sequences are expressly forbidden in the UTF-8 standard due to
potential security issues).  Another malformation example is the first byte of
a character not being a legal first byte.  See F<utf8.h> for the list of such
flags.  Even if allowed, this function generally returns the Unicode
REPLACEMENT CHARACTER when it encounters a malformation.  There are flags in
F<utf8.h> to override this behavior for the overlong malformations, but don't
do that except for very specialized purposes.

The C<UTF8_CHECK_ONLY> flag overrides the behavior when a non-allowed (by other
flags) malformation is found.  If this flag is set, the routine assumes that
the caller will raise a warning, and this function will silently just set
C<retlen> to C<-1> (cast to C<STRLEN>) and return zero.

Note that this API requires disambiguation between successful decoding a C<NUL>
character, and an error return (unless the C<UTF8_CHECK_ONLY> flag is set), as
in both cases, 0 is returned, and, depending on the malformation, C<retlen> may
be set to 1.  To disambiguate, upon a zero return, see if the first byte of
C<s> is 0 as well.  If so, the input was a C<NUL>; if not, the input had an
error.  Or you can use C<L</utf8n_to_uvchr_error>>.

Certain code points are considered problematic.  These are Unicode surrogates,
Unicode non-characters, and code points above the Unicode maximum of 0x10FFFF.
By default these are considered regular code points, but certain situations
warrant special handling for them, which can be specified using the C<flags>
parameter.  If C<flags> contains C<UTF8_DISALLOW_ILLEGAL_INTERCHANGE>, all
three classes are treated as malformations and handled as such.  The flags
C<UTF8_DISALLOW_SURROGATE>, C<UTF8_DISALLOW_NONCHAR>, and
C<UTF8_DISALLOW_SUPER> (meaning above the legal Unicode maximum) can be set to
disallow these categories individually.  C<UTF8_DISALLOW_ILLEGAL_INTERCHANGE>
restricts the allowed inputs to the strict UTF-8 traditionally defined by
Unicode.  Use C<UTF8_DISALLOW_ILLEGAL_C9_INTERCHANGE> to use the strictness
definition given by
L<Unicode Corrigendum #9|https://www.unicode.org/versions/corrigendum9.html>.
The difference between traditional strictness and C9 strictness is that the
latter does not forbid non-character code points.  (They are still discouraged,
however.)  For more discussion see L<perlunicode/Noncharacter code points>.

The flags C<UTF8_WARN_ILLEGAL_INTERCHANGE>,
C<UTF8_WARN_ILLEGAL_C9_INTERCHANGE>, C<UTF8_WARN_SURROGATE>,
C<UTF8_WARN_NONCHAR>, and C<UTF8_WARN_SUPER> will cause warning messages to be
raised for their respective categories, but otherwise the code points are
considered valid (not malformations).  To get a category to both be treated as
a malformation and raise a warning, specify both the WARN and DISALLOW flags.
(But note that warnings are not raised if lexically disabled nor if
C<UTF8_CHECK_ONLY> is also specified.)

Extremely high code points were never specified in any standard, and require an
extension to UTF-8 to express, which Perl does.  It is likely that programs
written in something other than Perl would not be able to read files that
contain these; nor would Perl understand files written by something that uses a
different extension.  For these reasons, there is a separate set of flags that
can warn and/or disallow these extremely high code points, even if other
above-Unicode ones are accepted.  They are the C<UTF8_WARN_PERL_EXTENDED> and
C<UTF8_DISALLOW_PERL_EXTENDED> flags.  For more information see
C<L</UTF8_GOT_PERL_EXTENDED>>.  Of course C<UTF8_DISALLOW_SUPER> will treat all
above-Unicode code points, including these, as malformations.
(Note that the Unicode standard considers anything above 0x10FFFF to be
illegal, but there are standards predating it that allow up to 0x7FFF_FFFF
(2**31 -1))

A somewhat misleadingly named synonym for C<UTF8_WARN_PERL_EXTENDED> is
retained for backward compatibility: C<UTF8_WARN_ABOVE_31_BIT>.  Similarly,
C<UTF8_DISALLOW_ABOVE_31_BIT> is usable instead of the more accurately named
C<UTF8_DISALLOW_PERL_EXTENDED>.  The names are misleading because these flags
can apply to code points that actually do fit in 31 bits.  This happens on
EBCDIC platforms, and sometimes when the L<overlong
malformation|/C<UTF8_GOT_LONG>> is also present.  The new names accurately
describe the situation in all cases.


All other code points corresponding to Unicode characters, including private
use and those yet to be assigned, are never considered malformed and never
warn.

THIS FUNCTION SHOULD BE USED IN ONLY VERY SPECIALIZED CIRCUMSTANCES.
Most code should use L</utf8_to_uvchr_buf>() rather than call this
directly.

This function is for code that needs to know what the precise malformation(s)
are when an error is found.  If you also need to know the generated warning
messages, use L</utf8n_to_uvchr_msgs>() instead.

It is like C<L</utf8n_to_uvchr>> but it takes an extra parameter placed after
all the others, C<errors>.  If this parameter is 0, this function behaves
identically to C<L</utf8n_to_uvchr>>.  Otherwise, C<errors> should be a pointer
to a C<U32> variable, which this function sets to indicate any errors found.
Upon return, if C<*errors> is 0, there were no errors found.  Otherwise,
C<*errors> is the bit-wise C<OR> of the bits described in the list below.  Some
of these bits will be set if a malformation is found, even if the input
C<flags> parameter indicates that the given malformation is allowed; those
exceptions are noted:

=over 4

=item C<UTF8_GOT_PERL_EXTENDED>

The input sequence is not standard UTF-8, but a Perl extension.  This bit is
set only if the input C<flags> parameter contains either the
C<UTF8_DISALLOW_PERL_EXTENDED> or the C<UTF8_WARN_PERL_EXTENDED> flags.

Code points above 0x7FFF_FFFF (2**31 - 1) were never specified in any standard,
and so some extension must be used to express them.  Perl uses a natural
extension to UTF-8 to represent the ones up to 2**36-1, and invented a further
extension to represent even higher ones, so that any code point that fits in a
64-bit word can be represented.  Text using these extensions is not likely to
be portable to non-Perl code.  We lump both of these extensions together and
refer to them as Perl extended UTF-8.  There exist other extensions that people
have invented, incompatible with Perl's.

On EBCDIC platforms starting in Perl v5.24, the Perl extension for representing
extremely high code points kicks in at 0x3FFF_FFFF (2**30 -1), which is lower
than on ASCII.  Prior to that, code points 2**31 and higher were simply
unrepresentable, and a different, incompatible method was used to represent
code points between 2**30 and 2**31 - 1.

On both platforms, ASCII and EBCDIC, C<UTF8_GOT_PERL_EXTENDED> is set if
Perl extended UTF-8 is used.

In earlier Perls, this bit was named C<UTF8_GOT_ABOVE_31_BIT>, which you still
may use for backward compatibility.  That name is misleading, as this flag may
be set when the code point actually does fit in 31 bits.  This happens on
EBCDIC platforms, and sometimes when the L<overlong
malformation|/C<UTF8_GOT_LONG>> is also present.  The new name accurately
describes the situation in all cases.

=item C<UTF8_GOT_CONTINUATION>

The input sequence was malformed in that the first byte was a UTF-8
continuation byte.

=item C<UTF8_GOT_EMPTY>

The input C<curlen> parameter was 0.

=item C<UTF8_GOT_LONG>

The input sequence was malformed in that there is some other sequence that
evaluates to the same code point, but that sequence is shorter than this one.

Until Unicode 3.1, it was legal for programs to accept this malformation, but
it was discovered that this created security issues.

=item C<UTF8_GOT_NONCHAR>

The code point represented by the input UTF-8 sequence is for a Unicode
non-character code point.
This bit is set only if the input C<flags> parameter contains either the
C<UTF8_DISALLOW_NONCHAR> or the C<UTF8_WARN_NONCHAR> flags.

=item C<UTF8_GOT_NON_CONTINUATION>

The input sequence was malformed in that a non-continuation type byte was found
in a position where only a continuation type one should be.  See also
C<L</UTF8_GOT_SHORT>>.

=item C<UTF8_GOT_OVERFLOW>

The input sequence was malformed in that it is for a code point that is not
representable in the number of bits available in an IV on the current platform.

=item C<UTF8_GOT_SHORT>

The input sequence was malformed in that C<curlen> is smaller than required for
a complete sequence.  In other words, the input is for a partial character
sequence.


C<UTF8_GOT_SHORT> and C<UTF8_GOT_NON_CONTINUATION> both indicate a too short
sequence.  The difference is that C<UTF8_GOT_NON_CONTINUATION> indicates always
that there is an error, while C<UTF8_GOT_SHORT> means that an incomplete
sequence was looked at.   If no other flags are present, it means that the
sequence was valid as far as it went.  Depending on the application, this could
mean one of three things:

=over

=item *

The C<curlen> length parameter passed in was too small, and the function was
prevented from examining all the necessary bytes.

=item *

The buffer being looked at is based on reading data, and the data received so
far stopped in the middle of a character, so that the next read will
read the remainder of this character.  (It is up to the caller to deal with the
split bytes somehow.)

=item *

This is a real error, and the partial sequence is all we're going to get.

=back

=item C<UTF8_GOT_SUPER>

The input sequence was malformed in that it is for a non-Unicode code point;
that is, one above the legal Unicode maximum.
This bit is set only if the input C<flags> parameter contains either the
C<UTF8_DISALLOW_SUPER> or the C<UTF8_WARN_SUPER> flags.

=item C<UTF8_GOT_SURROGATE>

The input sequence was malformed in that it is for a -Unicode UTF-16 surrogate
code point.

THIS FUNCTION SHOULD BE USED IN ONLY VERY SPECIALIZED CIRCUMSTANCES.
Most code should use L</utf8_to_uvchr_buf>() rather than call this
directly.

This function is for code that needs to know what the precise malformation(s)
are when an error is found, and wants the corresponding warning and/or error
messages to be returned to the caller rather than be displayed.  All messages
that would have been displayed if all lexical warnings are enabled will be
returned.

It is just like C<L</utf8n_to_uvchr_error>> but it takes an extra parameter
placed after all the others, C<msgs>.  If this parameter is 0, this function
behaves identically to C<L</utf8n_to_uvchr_error>>.  Otherwise, C<msgs> should
be a pointer to an C<AV *> variable, in which this function creates a new AV to
contain any appropriate messages.  The elements of the array are ordered so
that the first message that would have been displayed is in the 0th element,
and so on.  Each element is a hash with three key-value pairs, as follows:

=over 4

=item C<text>

The text of the message as a C<SVpv>.

=item C<warn_categories>

The warning category (or categories) packed into a C<SVuv>.

=item C<flag>

A single flag bit associated with this message, in a C<SVuv>.
The bit corresponds to some bit in the C<*errors> return value,
such as C<UTF8_GOT_LONG>.

=back

It's important to note that specifying this parameter as non-null will cause
any warnings this function would otherwise generate to be suppressed, and
instead be placed in C<*msgs>.  The caller can check the lexical warnings state
(or not) when choosing what to do with the returned messages.

If the flag C<UTF8_CHECK_ONLY> is passed, no warnings are generated, and hence
no AV is created.

The caller, of course, is responsible for freeing any returned AV.

This is a safer version of C<L</UTF8SKIP>>, but still not as safe as

string pointed to by C<s> is well-formed, but verifies that there isn't a NUL
terminating character before the expected end of the next character in C<s>.
The length C<UTF8_CHK_SKIP> returns stops just before any such NUL.

Perl tends to add NULs, as an insurance policy, after the end of strings in
SV's, so it is likely that using this macro will prevent inadvertent reading
beyond the end of the input buffer, even if it is malformed UTF-8.

This macro is intended to be used by XS modules where the inputs could be
malformed, and it isn't feasible to restructure to use the safer

is why this function is deprecated.  Use L</utf8_to_uvchr_buf> instead.

If C<s> points to one of the detected malformations, and UTF8 warnings are
enabled, zero is returned and C<*retlen> is set (if C<retlen> isn't

the Unicode REPLACEMENT CHARACTER, if not) is silently returned, and C<*retlen>

next possible position in C<s> that could begin a non-malformed character.

C<UTF8_MAXBYTES+1>) free bytes available.  The return value is the pointer to
the byte after the end of the new character.  In other words,

    d = uvchr_to_utf8_flags(d, uv, flags);

or, in most cases,

    d = uvchr_to_utf8_flags(d, uv, 0);

This is the Unicode-aware way of saying

    *(d++) = uv;

If C<flags> is 0, this function accepts any code point from 0..C<IV_MAX> as
input.  C<IV_MAX> is typically 0x7FFF_FFFF in a 32-bit word.

Specifying C<flags> can further restrict what is allowed and not warned on, as
follows:

If C<uv> is a Unicode surrogate code point and C<UNICODE_WARN_SURROGATE> is set,
the function will raise a warning, provided UTF8 warnings are enabled.  If
instead C<UNICODE_DISALLOW_SURROGATE> is set, the function will fail and return
NULL.  If both flags are set, the function will both warn and return NULL.

Similarly, the C<UNICODE_WARN_NONCHAR> and C<UNICODE_DISALLOW_NONCHAR> flags
affect how the function handles a Unicode non-character.

And likewise, the C<UNICODE_WARN_SUPER> and C<UNICODE_DISALLOW_SUPER> flags
affect the handling of code points that are above the Unicode maximum of
0x10FFFF.  Languages other than Perl may not be able to accept files that
contain these.

The flag C<UNICODE_WARN_ILLEGAL_INTERCHANGE> selects all three of
the above WARN flags; and C<UNICODE_DISALLOW_ILLEGAL_INTERCHANGE> selects all
three DISALLOW flags.  C<UNICODE_DISALLOW_ILLEGAL_INTERCHANGE> restricts the
allowed inputs to the strict UTF-8 traditionally defined by Unicode.
Similarly, C<UNICODE_WARN_ILLEGAL_C9_INTERCHANGE> and
C<UNICODE_DISALLOW_ILLEGAL_C9_INTERCHANGE> are shortcuts to select the
above-Unicode and surrogate flags, but not the non-character ones, as
defined in
L<Unicode Corrigendum #9|https://www.unicode.org/versions/corrigendum9.html>.
See L<perlunicode/Noncharacter code points>.

Extremely high code points were never specified in any standard, and require an
extension to UTF-8 to express, which Perl does.  It is likely that programs
written in something other than Perl would not be able to read files that
contain these; nor would Perl understand files written by something that uses a
different extension.  For these reasons, there is a separate set of flags that
can warn and/or disallow these extremely high code points, even if other
above-Unicode ones are accepted.  They are the C<UNICODE_WARN_PERL_EXTENDED>
and C<UNICODE_DISALLOW_PERL_EXTENDED> flags.  For more information see
C<L</UTF8_GOT_PERL_EXTENDED>>.  Of course C<UNICODE_DISALLOW_SUPER> will
treat all above-Unicode code points, including these, as malformations.  (Note
that the Unicode standard considers anything above 0x10FFFF to be illegal, but
there are standards predating it that allow up to 0x7FFF_FFFF (2**31 -1))

A somewhat misleadingly named synonym for C<UNICODE_WARN_PERL_EXTENDED> is
retained for backward compatibility: C<UNICODE_WARN_ABOVE_31_BIT>.  Similarly,
C<UNICODE_DISALLOW_ABOVE_31_BIT> is usable instead of the more accurately named
C<UNICODE_DISALLOW_PERL_EXTENDED>.  The names are misleading because on EBCDIC
platforms,these flags can apply to code points that actually do fit in 31 bits.
The new names accurately describe the situation in all cases.

=item C<uvchr_to_utf8_flags_msgs>
X<uvchr_to_utf8_flags_msgs>

THIS FUNCTION SHOULD BE USED IN ONLY VERY SPECIALIZED CIRCUMSTANCES.

Most code should use C<L</uvchr_to_utf8_flags>()> rather than call this directly.

This function is for code that wants any warning and/or error messages to be
returned to the caller rather than be displayed.  All messages that would have
been displayed if all lexical warnings are enabled will be returned.

It is just like C<L</uvchr_to_utf8_flags>> but it takes an extra parameter
placed after all the others, C<msgs>.  If this parameter is 0, this function
behaves identically to C<L</uvchr_to_utf8_flags>>.  Otherwise, C<msgs> should
be a pointer to an C<HV *> variable, in which this function creates a new HV to
contain any appropriate messages.  The hash has three key-value pairs, as
follows:

=over 4

=item C<text>

The text of the message as a C<SVpv>.

=item C<warn_categories>

The warning category (or categories) packed into a C<SVuv>.

=item C<flag>

A single flag bit associated with this message, in a C<SVuv>.
The bit corresponds to some bit in the C<*errors> return value,
such as C<UNICODE_GOT_SURROGATE>.

=back

It's important to note that specifying this parameter as non-null will cause
any warnings this function would otherwise generate to be suppressed, and
instead be placed in C<*msgs>.  The caller can check the lexical warnings state
(or not) when choosing what to do with the returned messages.

The caller, of course, is responsible for freeing any returned HV.

(C<$@>) will be used as an error message or object instead of building an
error message from arguments.  If you want to throw a non-string object,
or build an error message in an SV yourself, it is preferable to use
the C<L</croak_sv>> function, which does not involve clobbering C<ERRSV>.

The two forms differ only in that C<croak_nocontext> does not take a thread
context (C<aTHX>) parameter.  It is usually preferred as it takes up fewer
bytes of code than plain C<Perl_croak>, and time is rarely a critical resource
when you are about to throw an exception.

NOTE: C<croak> must be explicitly called as
C<Perl_croak>
with an C<aTHX_> parameter.

This encapsulates a common reason for dying, generating terser object code than
using the generic C<Perl_croak>.  It is exactly equivalent to
C<Perl_croak(aTHX_ "%s", PL_no_modify)> (which expands to something like
"Modification of a read-only value attempted").

Less code used on exception code paths reduces CPU cache pressure.

X<croak_sv>

This is an XS interface to Perl's C<die> function.

C<baseex> is the error message or object.  If it is a reference, it
will be used as-is.  Otherwise it is used as a string, and if it does
not end with a newline then it will be extended with some indication of
the current location in the code, as described for L</mess_sv>.

The error message or object will be used as an exception, by default
returning control to the nearest enclosing C<eval>, but subject to
modification by a C<$SIG{__DIE__}> handler.  In any case, the C<croak_sv>
function never returns normally.

To die with a simple string message, the L</croak> function may be

categories.  If any of the warning categories they specify is fatal, a fatal
exception is thrown.

In any event a message is generated by the pattern and arguments.  If the
message does not end with a newline, then it will be extended with some
indication of the current location in the code, as described for L</mess_sv>.

The error message or object will by default be written to standard error,

These functions differ from the similarly named C<L</warn>> functions, in that
the latter are for XS code to unconditionally display a warning, whereas these
are for code that may be compiling a perl program, and does extra checking to
see if the warning should be fatal.

=head1 Undocumented elements

The following functions have been flagged as part of the public
API, but are currently undocumented.  Use them at your own risk,
as the interfaces are subject to change.  Functions that are not
listed in this document are not intended for public use, and
should NOT be used under any circumstances.

If you feel you need to use one of these functions, first send
email to L<perl5-porters@perl.org|mailto:perl5-porters@perl.org>.
It may be that there is a good reason for the function not being
documented, and it should be removed from this list; or it may
just be that no one has gotten around to documenting it.  In the
latter case, you will be asked to submit a patch to document the
function.  Once your patch is accepted, it will indicate that the
interface is stable (unless it is explicitly marked otherwise) and
usable by you.
